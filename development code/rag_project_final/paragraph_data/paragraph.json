    ".\r\nMR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.",
    "In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\r\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\r\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\r\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\r\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I\r\ncould join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\r\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\r\nwas already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many\r\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\r\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\r\nentered upon my new duties.",
    "The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\r\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\r\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\r\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\r\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\r\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\r\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\r\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.",
    "Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\r\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\r\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\r\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\r\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\r\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\r\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak\r\nand emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be\r\nlost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in\r\nthe troopship \"Orontes,\" and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,\r\nwith my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a\r\npaternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\r\nimprove it.",
    "I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\r\nair-or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\r\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\r\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\r\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a\r\nprivate hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\r\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\r\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I\r\nsoon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\r\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\r\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\r\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\r\npretentious and less expensive domicile.",
    "On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\r\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\r\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\r\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London\r\nis a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had\r\nnever been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with\r\nenthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In\r\nthe exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,\r\nand we started off together in a hansom.",
    "\"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\" he asked in\r\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\r\n\"You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\"",
    "I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\r\nby the time that we reached our destination.",
    "\"Poor devil!\" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\r\nmisfortunes. \"What are you up to now?\"",
    "\"Looking for lodgings,\" I answered. \"Trying to solve the problem as to\r\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\"",
    "\"That's a strange thing,\" remarked my companion; \"you are the second\r\nman to-day that has used that expression to me.\"",
    "\"And who was the first?\" I asked.",
    "\"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\r\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\r\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\r\nwere too much for his purse.\"",
    "\"By Jove!\" I cried, \"if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\r\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a\r\npartner to being alone.\"",
    "Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \"You\r\ndon't know Sherlock Holmes yet,\" he said; \"perhaps you would not care\r\nfor him as a constant companion.\"",
    "\"Why, what is there against him?\"",
    "\"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\r\nin his ideas-an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\r\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.\"",
    "\"A medical student, I suppose?\" said I.",
    "\"No-I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\r\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\r\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\r\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\r\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.\"",
    "\"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\" I asked.",
    "\"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\r\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\"",
    "\"I should like to meet him,\" I said. \"If I am to lodge with anyone, I\r\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\r\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\r\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\r\ncould I meet this friend of yours?\"",
    "\"He is sure to be at the laboratory,\" returned my companion. \"He either\r\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\r\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\"",
    "\"Certainly,\" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\r\nchannels.",
    "As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\r\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\r\ntake as a fellow-lodger.",
    "\"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,\" he said; \"I know\r\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally\r\nin the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold\r\nme responsible.\"",
    "\"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,\" I answered. \"It\r\nseems to me, Stamford,\" I added, looking hard at my companion, \"that\r\nyou have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this\r\nfellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed\r\nabout it.\"",
    "\"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\" he answered with a\r\nlaugh. \"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes-it approaches\r\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\r\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\r\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\r\naccurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would\r\ntake it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion\r\nfor definite and exact knowledge.\"",
    "\"Very right too.\"",
    "\"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\r\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\r\nrather a bizarre shape.\"",
    "\"Beating the subjects!\"",
    "\"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\r\nat it with my own eyes.\"",
    "\"And yet you say he is not a medical student?\"",
    "\"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,\r\nand you must form your own impressions about him.\" As he spoke, we\r\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\r\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\r\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\r\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall\r\nand dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\r\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.",
    "This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\r\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\r\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\r\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\r\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\r\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I've found it! I've\r\nfound it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\r\ntest-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\r\nby h\u00e6moglobin, and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered a gold mine,\r\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.",
    "\"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.",
    "\"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for\r\nwhich I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in\r\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\"",
    "\"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.",
    "\"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is about\r\nh\u00e6moglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\r\nmine?\"",
    "\"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but\r\npractically--\"",
    "\"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\r\nDon't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\r\nCome over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,\r\nand drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \"Let us\r\nhave some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,\r\nand drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.\r\n\"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You\r\nperceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.\r\nThe proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no\r\ndoubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic\r\nreaction.\" As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,\r\nand then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\r\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was\r\nprecipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.",
    "\"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\r\nchild with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"",
    "\"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.",
    "\"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\r\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\r\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\r\nappears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\r\nbeen invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\r\nwould long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"",
    "\"Indeed!\" I murmured.",
    "\"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\r\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\r\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\r\nthem. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\r\nstains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an\r\nexpert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the\r\nSherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\"",
    "His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\r\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\r\nimagination.",
    "\"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at\r\nhis enthusiasm.",
    "\"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\r\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\r\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\r\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases\r\nin which it would have been decisive.\"",
    "\"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a\r\nlaugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police\r\nNews of the Past.'\"",
    "\"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock\r\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\r\n\"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a smile, \"for\r\nI dabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand as he spoke,\r\nand I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of\r\nplaster, and discoloured with strong acids.",
    "\"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high\r\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\r\nfoot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\r\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\r\nthat I had better bring you together.\"",
    "Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\r\nme. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which would\r\nsuit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco,\r\nI hope?\"",
    "\"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,\" I answered.",
    "\"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\r\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?\"",
    "\"By no means.\"",
    "\"Let me see-what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\r\ntimes, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\r\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What\r\nhave you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the\r\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.\"",
    "I laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said, \"and\r\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\r\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of\r\nvices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.\"",
    "\"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\" he asked,\r\nanxiously.",
    "\"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a\r\ntreat for the gods-a badly-played one--\"",
    "\"Oh, that's all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may\r\nconsider the thing as settled-that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\r\nyou.\"",
    "\"When shall we see them?\"",
    "\"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle\r\neverything,\" he answered.",
    "\"All right-noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.",
    "We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\r\nmy hotel.",
    "\"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\r\n\"how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"",
    "My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That's just his little\r\npeculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he\r\nfinds things out.\"",
    "\"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very\r\npiquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper\r\nstudy of mankind is man,' you know.\"",
    "\"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\r\n\"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more\r\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.\"",
    "\"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\r\ninterested in my new acquaintance.",
    ".\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.",
    "We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\r\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\r\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\r\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\r\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\r\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\r\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\r\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\r\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\r\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\r\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\r\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\r\nsurroundings.",
    "Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in\r\nhis ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up\r\nafter ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\r\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\r\nchemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\r\noccasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest\r\nportions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\r\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\r\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\r\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these\r\noccasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,\r\nthat I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some\r\nnarcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life\r\nforbidden such a notion.",
    "As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\r\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\r\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\r\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\r\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\r\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\r\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\r\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\r\nsquareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\r\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\r\npossessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\r\noccasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\r\nphilosophical instruments.",
    "The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\r\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\r\nbreak through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\r\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\r\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\r\nattention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\r\nwas exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\r\nand break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my\r\ncompanion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.",
    "He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\r\nconfirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\r\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\r\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\r\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was\r\nremarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\r\nextraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\r\nastounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\r\ninformation unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers\r\nare seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man\r\nburdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\r\nfor doing so.",
    "His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\r\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\r\nnothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way\r\nwho he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,\r\nhowever, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the\r\nCopernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any\r\ncivilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware\r\nthat the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\r\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.",
    "\"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of\r\nsurprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"",
    "\"To forget it!\"",
    "\"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man's brain originally is\r\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\r\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\r\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\r\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so\r\nthat he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful\r\nworkman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his\r\nbrain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in\r\ndoing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the\r\nmost perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\r\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes\r\na time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that\r\nyou knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to\r\nhave useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\"",
    "\"But the Solar System!\" I protested.",
    "\"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently; \"you say that\r\nwe go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\r\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"",
    "I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\r\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\r\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\r\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\r\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\r\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\r\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\r\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\r\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It\r\nran in this way-",
    "SHERLOCK HOLMES-his limits.",
    "1. Knowledge of Literature.-Nil.\r\n2. Philosophy.-Nil.\r\n3. Astronomy.-Nil.\r\n4. Politics.-Feeble.\r\n5. Botany.-Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\r\ngenerally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\r\n6. Geology.-Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils\r\nfrom each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,\r\nand told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he\r\nhad received them.\r\n7. Chemistry.-Profound.\r\n8. Anatomy.-Accurate, but unsystematic.\r\n9. Sensational Literature.-Immense. He appears to know every detail of\r\nevery horror perpetrated in the century.\r\n10. Plays the violin well.\r\n11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\r\n12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.",
    "When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\r\n\"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\r\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\"\r\nI said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"",
    "I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\r\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\r\naccomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\r\nknew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's\r\nLieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would\r\nseldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in\r\nhis arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape\r\ncarelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\r\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were\r\nfantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which\r\npossessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether\r\nthe playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I\r\ncould determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos\r\nhad it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick\r\nsuccession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation\r\nfor the trial upon my patience.",
    "During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\r\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\r\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\r\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\r\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\r\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\r\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\r\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\r\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\r\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\r\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\r\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\r\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\r\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\r\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \"I\r\nhave to use this room as a place of business,\" he said, \"and these\r\npeople are my clients.\" Again I had an opportunity of asking him a\r\npoint blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing\r\nanother man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some\r\nstrong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by\r\ncoming round to the subject of his own accord.",
    "It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\r\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had\r\nnot yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed\r\nto my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee\r\nprepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell\r\nand gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a\r\nmagazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,\r\nwhile my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles\r\nhad a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye\r\nthrough it.",
    "Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted\r\nto show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\r\nsystematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\r\nbeing a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\r\nreasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\r\nbe far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\r\nexpression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\r\nman's inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\r\nin the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions\r\nwere as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\r\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\r\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him\r\nas a necromancer.",
    "\"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the\r\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\r\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\r\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\r\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\r\nby long and patient study nor, is life long enough to allow any mortal\r\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\r\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\r\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\r\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\r\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\r\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\r\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to\r\nlook for. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by\r\nhis trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by\r\nhis expression, by his shirt cuffs-by each of these things a man's\r\ncalling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten\r\nthe competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"",
    "\"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\r\ntable, \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"",
    "\"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.",
    "\"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\r\ndown to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have\r\nmarked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\r\nthough. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\r\nevolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\r\nstudy. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a\r\nthird class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades\r\nof all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against\r\nhim.\"",
    "\"You would lose your money,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \"As for\r\nthe article I wrote it myself.\"",
    "\"You!\"",
    "\"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\r\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\r\nchimerical are really extremely practical-so practical that I depend\r\nupon them for my bread and cheese.\"",
    "\"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.",
    "\"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\r\nworld. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\r\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\r\nprivate ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\r\nmanage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before\r\nme, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history\r\nof crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance\r\nabout misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your\r\nfinger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first.\r\nLestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\r\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\"",
    "\"And these other people?\"",
    "\"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\r\npeople who are in trouble about something, and want a little\r\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\r\nthen I pocket my fee.\"",
    "\"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you\r\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\r\nthey have seen every detail for themselves?\"",
    "\"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\r\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\r\nand see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\r\nknowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\r\nwonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\r\naroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation\r\nwith me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,\r\non our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\"",
    "\"You were told, no doubt.\"",
    "\"Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\r\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\r\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\r\nsteps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\r\n'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military\r\nman. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,\r\nfor his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\r\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his\r\nhaggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it\r\nin a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English\r\narmy doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\r\nAfghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I\r\nthen remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\"",
    "\"It is simple enough as you explain it,\" I said, smiling. \"You remind\r\nme of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\r\nexist outside of stories.\"",
    "Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \"No doubt you think that you are\r\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\" he observed. \"Now, in my\r\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of\r\nbreaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a\r\nquarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He\r\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\r\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\"",
    "\"Have you read Gaboriau's works?\" I asked. \"Does Lecoq come up to your\r\nidea of a detective?\"",
    "Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \"Lecoq was a miserable bungler,\"\r\nhe said, in an angry voice; \"he had only one thing to recommend him,\r\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\r\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\r\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\r\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\"",
    "I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\r\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\r\nlooking out into the busy street. \"This fellow may be very clever,\" I\r\nsaid to myself, \"but he is certainly very conceited.\"",
    "\"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\" he said,\r\nquerulously. \"What is the use of having brains in our profession. I\r\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\r\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\r\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\r\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\r\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\r\nofficial can see through it.\"",
    "I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\r\nit best to change the topic.",
    "\"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\" I asked, pointing to a\r\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\r\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\r\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\r\nmessage.",
    "\"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\" said Sherlock Holmes.",
    "\"Brag and bounce!\" thought I to myself. \"He knows that I cannot verify\r\nhis guess.\"",
    "The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\r\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\r\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\r\nascending the stair.",
    "\"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said, stepping into the room and handing\r\nmy friend the letter.",
    "Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\r\nthought of this when he made that random shot. \"May I ask, my lad,\" I\r\nsaid, in the blandest voice, \"what your trade may be?\"",
    "\"Commissionaire, sir,\" he said, gruffly. \"Uniform away for repairs.\"",
    "\"And you were?\" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\r\ncompanion.",
    "\"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\r\nsir.\"",
    "He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\r\ngone.",
    ".\r\nTHE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY",
    "I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\r\npractical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers\r\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\r\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\r\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could\r\nhave in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\r\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\r\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.",
    "\"How in the world did you deduce that?\" I asked.",
    "\"Deduce what?\" said he, petulantly.",
    "\"Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\"",
    "\"I have no time for trifles,\" he answered, brusquely; then with a\r\nsmile, \"Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but\r\nperhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that\r\nman was a sergeant of Marines?\"",
    "\"No, indeed.\"",
    "\"It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were\r\nasked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\r\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\r\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\r\nfellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\r\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\r\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\r\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his\r\ncane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\r\nhim-all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\"",
    "\"Wonderful!\" I ejaculated.",
    "\"Commonplace,\" said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that\r\nhe was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \"I said just now\r\nthat there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong-look at this!\"\r\nHe threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.",
    "\"Why,\" I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \"this is terrible!\"",
    "\"It does seem to be a little out of the common,\" he remarked, calmly.\r\n\"Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\"",
    "This is the letter which I read to him-",
    "\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,-",
    "\"There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston\r\nGardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there\r\nabout two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected\r\nthat something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front\r\nroom, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,\r\nwell dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch\r\nJ. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no robbery, nor is\r\nthere any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of\r\nblood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a\r\nloss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair\r\nis a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\r\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_\r\nuntil I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you\r\nfuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would\r\nfavour me with your opinion.",
    "Yours faithfully,\r\n                  \"TOBIAS GREGSON.\"",
    "\"Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" my friend remarked;\r\n\"he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\r\nenergetic, but conventional-shockingly so. They have their knives into\r\none another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\r\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\r\nupon the scent.\"",
    "I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \"Surely there is\r\nnot a moment to be lost,\" I cried, \"shall I go and order you a cab?\"",
    "\"I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\r\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather-that is, when the fit is on me,\r\nfor I can be spry enough at times.\"",
    "\"Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\"",
    "\"My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\r\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\r\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\"",
    "\"But he begs you to help him.\"",
    "\"Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\r\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\r\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\r\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\"",
    "He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\r\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.",
    "\"Get your hat,\" he said.",
    "\"You wish me to come?\"",
    "\"Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\" A minute later we were both in\r\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.",
    "It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\r\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\r\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\r\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an\r\nAmati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\r\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.",
    "\"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\" I said at\r\nlast, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.",
    "\"No data yet,\" he answered. \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before\r\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\"",
    "\"You will have your data soon,\" I remarked, pointing with my finger;\r\n\"this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\r\nmistaken.\"",
    "\"So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\" We were still a hundred yards or so\r\nfrom it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our\r\njourney upon foot.",
    "Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\r\nwas one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\r\nbeing occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of\r\nvacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here\r\nand there a \"To Let\" card had developed like a cataract upon the\r\nbleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption\r\nof sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and\r\nwas traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting\r\napparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very\r\nsloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was\r\nbounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\r\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,\r\nsurrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and\r\nstrained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the\r\nproceedings within.",
    "I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\r\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\r\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\r\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\r\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\r\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\r\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\r\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\r\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an\r\nexclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon\r\nthe wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going\r\nover it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn\r\nanything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the\r\nquickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he\r\ncould see a great deal which was hidden from me.",
    "At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\r\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\r\nwrung my companion's hand with effusion. \"It is indeed kind of you to\r\ncome,\" he said, \"I have had everything left untouched.\"",
    "\"Except that!\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \"If a herd\r\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\r\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\r\npermitted this.\"",
    "\"I have had so much to do inside the house,\" the detective said\r\nevasively. \"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\r\nto look after this.\"",
    "Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \"With two\r\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\r\nmuch for a third party to find out,\" he said.",
    "Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \"I think we have done\r\nall that can be done,\" he answered; \"it's a queer case though, and I\r\nknew your taste for such things.\"",
    "\"You did not come here in a cab?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.",
    "\"No, sir.\"",
    "\"Nor Lestrade?\"",
    "\"No, sir.\"",
    "\"Then let us go and look at the room.\" With which inconsequent remark\r\nhe strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\r\nexpressed his astonishment.",
    "A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\r\noffices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\r\nof these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\r\nto the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\r\naffair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\r\nsubdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.",
    "It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of\r\nall furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\r\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\r\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\r\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\r\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\r\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\r\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\r\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole\r\napartment.",
    "All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\r\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\r\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\r\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\r\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\r\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\r\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and\r\ncuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\r\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\r\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been\r\na grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\r\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\r\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\r\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a\r\nsingularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his\r\nwrithing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never\r\nhas it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\r\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\r\nLondon.",
    "Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\r\nand greeted my companion and myself.",
    "\"This case will make a stir, sir,\" he remarked. \"It beats anything I\r\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.\"",
    "\"There is no clue?\" said Gregson.",
    "\"None at all,\" chimed in Lestrade.",
    "Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\r\nintently. \"You are sure that there is no wound?\" he asked, pointing to\r\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.",
    "\"Positive!\" cried both detectives.",
    "\"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual-presumably\r\nthe murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the\r\ncircumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the\r\nyear '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\"",
    "\"No, sir.\"",
    "\"Read it up-you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\r\nhas all been done before.\"",
    "As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\r\neverywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\r\nwore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\r\nSo swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed\r\nthe minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the\r\ndead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather\r\nboots.",
    "\"He has not been moved at all?\" he asked.",
    "\"No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\"",
    "\"You can take him to the mortuary now,\" he said. \"There is nothing more\r\nto be learned.\"",
    "Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\r\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\r\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\r\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.",
    "\"There's been a woman here,\" he cried. \"It's a woman's wedding-ring.\"",
    "He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\r\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\r\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.",
    "\"This complicates matters,\" said Gregson. \"Heaven knows, they were\r\ncomplicated enough before.\"",
    "\"You're sure it doesn't simplify them?\" observed Holmes. \"There's\r\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\r\npockets?\"",
    "\"We have it all here,\" said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\r\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \"A gold watch, No. 97163,\r\nby Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold\r\nring, with masonic device. Gold pin-bull-dog's head, with rubies as\r\neyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of\r\nCleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,\r\nbut loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition\r\nof Boccaccio's _Decameron_, with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\r\nfly-leaf. Two letters-one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\r\nStangerson.\"",
    "\"At what address?\"",
    "\"American Exchange, Strand-to be left till called for. They are both\r\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\r\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about\r\nto return to New York.\"",
    "\"Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\"",
    "\"I did it at once, sir,\" said Gregson. \"I have had advertisements sent\r\nto all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\r\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.\"",
    "\"Have you sent to Cleveland?\"",
    "\"We telegraphed this morning.\"",
    "\"How did you word your inquiries?\"",
    "\"We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\r\nof any information which could help us.\"",
    "\"You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\r\nbe crucial?\"",
    "\"I asked about Stangerson.\"",
    "\"Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case\r\nappears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\"",
    "\"I have said all I have to say,\" said Gregson, in an offended voice.",
    "Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\r\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\r\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\r\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.",
    "\"Mr. Gregson,\" he said, \"I have just made a discovery of the highest\r\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\r\ncareful examination of the walls.\"",
    "The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a\r\nstate of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\r\ncolleague.",
    "\"Come here,\" he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\r\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \"Now, stand\r\nthere!\"",
    "He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.",
    "\"Look at that!\" he said, triumphantly.",
    "I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\r\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\r\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\r\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word-",
    "RACHE.",
    "\"What do you think of that?\" cried the detective, with the air of a\r\nshowman exhibiting his show. \"This was overlooked because it was in the\r\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\r\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\r\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\r\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\r\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\r\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion\r\nof the wall.\"",
    "\"And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\" asked Gregson in\r\na depreciatory voice.",
    "\"Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\r\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\r\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\r\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It's all very well for\r\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever,\r\nbut the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\"",
    "\"I really beg your pardon!\" said my companion, who had ruffled the\r\nlittle man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \"You\r\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\r\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the\r\nother participant in last night's mystery. I have not had time to\r\nexamine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\"",
    "As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\r\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\r\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\r\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\r\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\r\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of\r\nexclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\r\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\r\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\r\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\r\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\r\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\r\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying\r\nhis tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one\r\nplace he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the\r\nfloor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his\r\nglass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the\r\nmost minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\r\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.",
    "\"They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" he\r\nremarked with a smile. \"It's a very bad definition, but it does apply\r\nto detective work.\"",
    "Gregson and Lestrade had watched the man\u0153uvres of their amateur\r\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\r\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\r\nSherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some\r\ndefinite and practical end.",
    "\"What do you think of it, sir?\" they both asked.",
    "\"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\r\nto help you,\" remarked my friend. \"You are doing so well now that it\r\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.\" There was a world of sarcasm\r\nin his voice as he spoke. \"If you will let me know how your\r\ninvestigations go,\" he continued, \"I shall be happy to give you any\r\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\r\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?\"",
    "Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \"John Rance,\" he said. \"He is off\r\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\"",
    "Holmes took a note of the address.",
    "\"Come along, Doctor,\" he said; \"we shall go and look him up. I'll tell\r\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,\" he continued, turning to\r\nthe two detectives. \"There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\r\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\r\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\r\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\r\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\r\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and\r\nthe finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only\r\na few indications, but they may assist you.\"",
    "Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.",
    "\"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\" asked the former.",
    "\"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \"One other\r\nthing, Lestrade,\" he added, turning round at the door: \"'Rache,' is the\r\nGerman for 'revenge;' so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\"",
    "With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\r\nopen-mouthed behind him.",
    ".\r\nWHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.",
    "It was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\r\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\r\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\r\nto the address given us by Lestrade.",
    "\"There is nothing like first hand evidence,\" he remarked; \"as a matter\r\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\r\nwell learn all that is to be learned.\"",
    "\"You amaze me, Holmes,\" said I. \"Surely you are not as sure as you\r\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\"",
    "\"There's no room for a mistake,\" he answered. \"The very first thing\r\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\r\nwith its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\r\nno rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\r\nimpression must have been there during the night. There were the marks\r\nof the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more\r\nclearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new\r\nshoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there\r\nat any time during the morning-I have Gregson's word for that-it\r\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,\r\nthat it brought those two individuals to the house.\"",
    "\"That seems simple enough,\" said I; \"but how about the other man's\r\nheight?\"",
    "\"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\r\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\r\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow's stride\r\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\r\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct\r\nleads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing\r\nwas just over six feet from the ground. It was child's play.\"",
    "\"And his age?\" I asked.",
    "\"Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\r\neffort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\r\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\r\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\r\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\r\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\r\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\"",
    "\"The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\" I suggested.",
    "\"The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in\r\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\r\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's\r\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\r\nIt was dark in colour and flakey-such an ash as is only made by a\r\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes-in fact, I\r\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\r\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or\r\nof tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\r\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\"",
    "\"And the florid face?\" I asked.",
    "\"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\r\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\"",
    "I passed my hand over my brow. \"My head is in a whirl,\" I remarked;\r\n\"the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these\r\ntwo men-if there were two men-into an empty house? What has become of\r\nthe cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take\r\npoison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the\r\nmurderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman's ring\r\nthere? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word\r\nRACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of\r\nreconciling all these facts.\"",
    "My companion smiled approvingly.",
    "\"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\" he\r\nsaid. \"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\r\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade's discovery it was\r\nsimply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\r\nsuggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.\r\nThe A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.\r\nNow, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we\r\nmay safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy\r\nimitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry\r\ninto a wrong channel. I'm not going to tell you much more of the case,\r\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained\r\nhis trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will\r\ncome to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\"",
    "\"I shall never do that,\" I answered; \"you have brought detection as\r\nnear an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\"",
    "My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\r\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\r\nsensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\r\nher beauty.",
    "\"I'll tell you one other thing,\" he said. \"Patent-leathers and\r\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\r\ntogether as friendly as possible-arm-in-arm, in all probability. When\r\nthey got inside they walked up and down the room-or rather,\r\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\r\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\r\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of\r\nhis strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no\r\ndoubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I've told you all I know\r\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\r\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want\r\nto go to Halle's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\"",
    "This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\r\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\r\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\r\n\"That's Audley Court in there,\" he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\r\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. \"You'll find me here when you come\r\nback.\"",
    "Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\r\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\r\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\r\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was\r\ndecorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\r\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\r\nwere shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.",
    "He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\r\nhis slumbers. \"I made my report at the office,\" he said.",
    "Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\r\npensively. \"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\r\nlips,\" he said.",
    "\"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\" the constable\r\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.",
    "\"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\"",
    "Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\r\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.",
    "\"I'll tell it ye from the beginning,\" he said. \"My time is from ten at\r\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the 'White\r\nHart'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o'clock it\r\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher-him who has the Holland Grove\r\nbeat-and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin'.\r\nPresently-maybe about two or a little after-I thought I would take a\r\nlook round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\r\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\r\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin' down, thinkin'\r\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\r\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\r\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\r\non account of him that owns them who won't have the drains seen to,\r\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid\r\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the\r\nwindow, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\r\ndoor--\"",
    "\"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\" my companion\r\ninterrupted. \"What did you do that for?\"",
    "Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\r\nutmost amazement upon his features.",
    "\"Why, that's true, sir,\" he said; \"though how you come to know it,\r\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\r\nand so lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one with\r\nme. I ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave; but I\r\nthought that maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the\r\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I\r\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but\r\nthere wasn't no sign of him nor of anyone else.\"",
    "\"There was no one in the street?\"",
    "\"Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\r\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\r\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. There was a\r\ncandle flickerin' on the mantelpiece-a red wax one-and by its light I\r\nsaw--\"",
    "\"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\r\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\r\nthe kitchen door, and then--\"",
    "John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\r\nhis eyes. \"Where was you hid to see all that?\" he cried. \"It seems to\r\nme that you knows a deal more than you should.\"",
    "Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\r\n\"Don't get arresting me for the murder,\" he said. \"I am one of the\r\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\r\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?\"",
    "Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\r\nexpression. \"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\r\nbrought Murcher and two more to the spot.\"",
    "\"Was the street empty then?\"",
    "\"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\"",
    "\"What do you mean?\"",
    "The constable's features broadened into a grin. \"I've seen many a drunk\r\nchap in my time,\" he said, \"but never anyone so cryin' drunk as that\r\ncove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up agin the\r\nrailings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about Columbine's\r\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn't stand, far less\r\nhelp.\"",
    "\"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.",
    "John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \"He\r\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o' man,\" he said. \"He'd ha' found hisself in\r\nthe station if we hadn't been so took up.\"",
    "\"His face-his dress-didn't you notice them?\" Holmes broke in\r\nimpatiently.",
    "\"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up-me\r\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\r\npart muffled round--\"",
    "\"That will do,\" cried Holmes. \"What became of him?\"",
    "\"We'd enough to do without lookin' after him,\" the policeman said, in\r\nan aggrieved voice. \"I'll wager he found his way home all right.\"",
    "\"How was he dressed?\"",
    "\"A brown overcoat.\"",
    "\"Had he a whip in his hand?\"",
    "\"A whip-no.\"",
    "\"He must have left it behind,\" muttered my companion. \"You didn't\r\nhappen to see or hear a cab after that?\"",
    "\"No.\"",
    "\"There's a half-sovereign for you,\" my companion said, standing up and\r\ntaking his hat. \"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\r\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\r\nmight have gained your sergeant's stripes last night. The man whom you\r\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\r\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell\r\nyou that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\"",
    "We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\r\nbut obviously uncomfortable.",
    "\"The blundering fool,\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\r\nlodgings. \"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\r\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.\"",
    "\"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\r\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\r\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\r\nof criminals.\"",
    "\"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\r\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\r\nshall have him, Doctor-I'll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\r\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\r\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why\r\nshouldn't we use a little art jargon. There's the scarlet thread of\r\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to\r\nunravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for\r\nlunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are\r\nsplendid. What's that little thing of Chopin's she plays so\r\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\"",
    "Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\r\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.",
    ".\r\nOUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.",
    "Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\r\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' departure for the concert, I\r\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep.\r\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\r\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.\r\nEvery time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\r\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\r\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\r\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\r\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\r\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\r\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\r\ndepravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.",
    "The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's\r\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\r\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\r\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had\r\ncaused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\r\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay\r\nso thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had\r\nthe victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.\r\nAs long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would\r\nbe no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet\r\nself-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory\r\nwhich explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an\r\ninstant conjecture.",
    "He was very late in returning-so late, that I knew that the concert\r\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\r\nbefore he appeared.",
    "\"It was magnificent,\" he said, as he took his seat. \"Do you remember\r\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\r\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\r\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\r\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\r\nwhen the world was in its childhood.\"",
    "\"That's rather a broad idea,\" I remarked.",
    "\"One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\r\nNature,\" he answered. \"What's the matter? You're not looking quite\r\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\"",
    "\"To tell the truth, it has,\" I said. \"I ought to be more case-hardened\r\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\r\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.\"",
    "\"I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\r\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\r\nseen the evening paper?\"",
    "\"No.\"",
    "\"It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\r\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman's wedding ring fell upon\r\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.\"",
    "\"Why?\"",
    "\"Look at this advertisement,\" he answered. \"I had one sent to every\r\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.\"",
    "He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\r\nIt was the first announcement in the \"Found\" column. \"In Brixton Road,\r\nthis morning,\" it ran, \"a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\r\nbetween the 'White Hart' Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\r\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\"",
    "\"Excuse my using your name,\" he said. \"If I used my own some of these\r\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\"",
    "\"That is all right,\" I answered. \"But supposing anyone applies, I have\r\nno ring.\"",
    "\"Oh yes, you have,\" said he, handing me one. \"This will do very well.\r\nIt is almost a facsimile.\"",
    "\"And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\"",
    "\"Why, the man in the brown coat-our florid friend with the square toes.\r\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\"",
    "\"Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\"",
    "\"Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\r\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose\r\nthe ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over\r\nDrebber's body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the\r\nhouse he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police\r\nalready in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle\r\nburning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions\r\nwhich might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put\r\nyourself in that man's place. On thinking the matter over, it must have\r\noccurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the\r\nroad after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\r\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the\r\narticles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be\r\noverjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his\r\neyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.\r\nHe would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?\"",
    "\"And then?\" I asked.",
    "\"Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\"",
    "\"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\"",
    "\"You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\r\nthough I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\r\nanything.\"",
    "I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the\r\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\r\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.",
    "\"The plot thickens,\" he said, as I entered; \"I have just had an answer\r\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\"",
    "\"And that is?\" I asked eagerly.",
    "\"My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\" he remarked. \"Put your\r\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\r\nordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don't frighten him by looking at\r\nhim too hard.\"",

    "As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\r\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\r\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\r\nopened it.",
    "\"Does Dr. Watson live here?\" asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\r\ncould not hear the servant's reply, but the door closed, and some one\r\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\r\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\r\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a\r\nfeeble tap at the door.",
    "\"Come in,\" I cried.",
    "At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\r\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\r\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\r\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\r\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\r\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do\r\nto keep my countenance.",
    "The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\r\nadvertisement. \"It's this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\" she said,\r\ndropping another curtsey; \"a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road.

    "The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\r\nred-rimmed eyes. \"The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\" she said.\r\n\"Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\"",
    "\"And your name is--?\"",
    "\"My name is Sawyer-her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her-and a\r\nsmart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the\r\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and\r\nwhat with liquor shops--\"",
    "\"Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\" I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\r\nfrom my companion; \"it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\r\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\"",
    "With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old\r\ncrone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and\r\nrushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an\r\nulster and a cravat. \"I'll follow her,\" he said, hurriedly; \"she must\r\nbe an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\" The hall\r\ndoor had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended\r\nthe stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly\r\nalong the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance\r\nbehind. \"Either his whole theory is incorrect,\" I thought to myself,\r\n\"or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.\" There was no\r\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\r\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.",
    "It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\r\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\r\nof Henri Murger's \"Vie de Boh\u00e8me.\" Ten o'clock passed, and I heard the\r\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more\r\nstately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\r\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\r\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\r\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\r\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\r\nhearty laugh.",
    "\"I wouldn't have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\" he cried,\r\ndropping into his chair; \"I have chaffed them so much that they would\r\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\r\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.\"",
    "\"What is it then?\" I asked.",
    "\"Oh, I don't mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\r\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\r\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler\r\nwhich was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the\r\naddress, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud\r\nenough to be heard at the other side of the street, 'Drive to 13,\r\nDuncan Street, Houndsditch,' she cried. This begins to look genuine, I\r\nthought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.\r\nThat's an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away\r\nwe rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\r\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down\r\nthe street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver\r\njumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing\r\ncame out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in\r\nthe empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of\r\noaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his\r\npassenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On\r\ninquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a\r\nrespectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name\r\neither of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.\"",
    "\"You don't mean to say,\" I cried, in amazement, \"that that tottering,\r\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\r\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?\"",
    "\"Old woman be damned!\" said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \"We were the old\r\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active\r\none, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\r\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\r\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\r\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\r\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\r\nand turn in.\"",
    "I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left\r\nHolmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\r\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his\r\nviolin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem\r\nwhich he had set himself to unravel.",
    ".\r\nTOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.",
    "The papers next day were full of the \"Brixton Mystery,\" as they termed\r\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\r\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\r\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\r\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:-",
    "The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\r\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\r\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\r\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\r\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\r\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\r\nlaws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\r\nVehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,\r\nthe Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\r\nHighway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\r\nand advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.",
    "The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\r\nsort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\r\nthe unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\r\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been\r\nresiding for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\r\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\r\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\r\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th\r\ninst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\r\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\r\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body\r\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\r\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\r\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\r\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\r\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\r\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\r\nthrow light upon the matter.",
    "The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\r\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\r\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\r\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\r\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\r\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\r\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\r\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\r\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\r\nof the house at which he had boarded-a result which was entirely due to\r\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.",
    "Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast,\r\nand they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.",
    "\"I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\r\nto score.\"",
    "\"That depends on how it turns out.\"",
    "\"Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. If the man is caught,\r\nit will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be\r\n_in spite_ of their exertions. It's heads I win and tails you lose.\r\nWhatever they do, they will have followers. 'Un sot trouve toujours un\r\nplus sot qui l'admire.'\"",
    "\"What on earth is this?\" I cried, for at this moment there came the\r\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\r\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.",
    "\"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\" said my\r\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\r\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\r\neyes on.",
    "\"'Tention!\" cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\r\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \"In\r\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\r\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\"",
    "\"No, sir, we hain't,\" said one of the youths.",
    "\"I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\r\nyour wages.\" He handed each of them a shilling.",
    "\"Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\"",
    "He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\r\nrats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.",
    "\"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\r\nout of a dozen of the force,\" Holmes remarked. \"The mere sight of an\r\nofficial-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go\r\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\r\nthey want is organisation.\"",
    "\"Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\" I asked.",
    "\"Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\r\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\r\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\r\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There\r\nhe is!\"",
    "There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\r\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\r\nburst into our sitting-room.",
    "\"My dear fellow,\" he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand,\r\n\"congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\"",
    "A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive\r\nface.",
    "\"Do you mean that you are on the right track?\" he asked.",
    "\"The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\"",
    "\"And his name is?\"",
    "\"Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's navy,\" cried\r\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.",
    "Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.",
    "\"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,\" he said. \"We are anxious to\r\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\"",
    "\"I don't mind if I do,\" the detective answered. \"The tremendous\r\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\r\nworn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain\r\nupon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we\r\nare both brain-workers.\"",
    "\"You do me too much honour,\" said Holmes, gravely. \"Let us hear how you\r\narrived at this most gratifying result.\"",
    "The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\r\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\r\namusement.",
    "\"The fun of it is,\" he cried, \"that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\r\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\r\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\r\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\r\ntime.\"",
    "The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.",
    "\"And how did you get your clue?\"",
    "\"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\r\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\r\ncontend with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some\r\npeople would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\r\nuntil parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\r\nTobias Gregson's way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the\r\ndead man?\"",
    "\"Yes,\" said Holmes; \"by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\"",
    "Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.",
    "\"I had no idea that you noticed that,\" he said. \"Have you been there?\"",
    "\"No.\"",
    "\"Ha!\" cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \"you should never neglect a\r\nchance, however small it may seem.\"",
    "\"To a great mind, nothing is little,\" remarked Holmes, sententiously.",
    "\"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\r\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\r\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier's\r\nBoarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\"",
    "\"Smart-very smart!\" murmured Sherlock Holmes.",
    "\"I next called upon Madame Charpentier,\" continued the detective. \"I\r\nfound her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\r\ntoo-an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the\r\neyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn't escape my\r\nnotice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent-a kind of thrill in your\r\nnerves. 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder\r\nMr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.",
    "\"The mother nodded. She didn't seem able to get out a word. The\r\ndaughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew\r\nsomething of the matter.",
    "\"'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I\r\nasked.",
    "\"'At eight o'clock,' she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\r\nagitation. 'His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\r\ntrains-one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.'",
    "\"'And was that the last which you saw of him?'",
    "\"A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question.\r\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\r\ncould get out the single word 'Yes'-and when it did come it was in a\r\nhusky unnatural tone.",
    "\"There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\r\nclear voice.",
    "\"'No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,' she said. 'Let us be\r\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.'",
    "\"'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\r\nsinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'",
    "\"'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered\r\nfirmly.",
    "\"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences are\r\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.'",
    "\"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to\r\nme, 'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\r\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in\r\nthis terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\r\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\r\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,\r\nhis profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'",
    "\"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.\r\n'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'",
    "\"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and her\r\ndaughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention of\r\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\r\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\r\nwithout omitting any particular.'",
    "\"'It is your wisest course,' said I.",
    "\"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\r\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\r\nnoticed a \"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that\r\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\r\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\r\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of\r\nhis arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after\r\ntwelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His\r\nmanners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.\r\nWorst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\r\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,\r\nfortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he\r\nactually seized her in his arms and embraced her-an outrage which\r\ncaused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.'",
    "\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can get\r\nrid of your boarders when you wish.'",
    "\"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God that\r\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said. 'But it\r\nwas a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each-fourteen\r\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy\r\nin the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for\r\nthe best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to\r\nleave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.'",
    "\"'Well?'",
    "\"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\r\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\r\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\r\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\r\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\r\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\r\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\r\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his\r\ntrain. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to\r\nher that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and there\r\nis no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the\r\nold girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live\r\nlike a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away\r\nfrom him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her\r\ntowards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came\r\ninto the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the\r\nconfused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.\r\nWhen I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with\r\na stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us\r\nagain,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and see what he does with\r\nhimself.\" With those words he took his hat and started off down the\r\nstreet. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.'",
    "\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\r\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.\r\nI made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there\r\nshould be no possibility of a mistake.\"",
    "\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What\r\nhappened next?\"",
    "\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that\r\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\r\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her\r\nson returned.",
    "\"'I do not know,' she answered.",
    "\"'Not know?'",
    "\"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'",
    "\"'After you went to bed?'",
    "\"'Yes.'",
    "\"'When did you go to bed?'",
    "\"'About eleven.'",
    "\"'So your son was gone at least two hours?'",
    "\"'Yes.'",
    "\"'Possibly four or five?'",
    "\"'Yes.'",
    "\"'What was he doing during that time?'",
    "\"'I do not know,' she answered, turning white to her very lips.",
    "\"Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out\r\nwhere Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\r\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\r\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you are\r\narresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\r\nDrebber,' he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\r\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\"",
    "\"Very,\" said Holmes.",
    "\"He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\r\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\"",
    "\"What is your theory, then?\"",
    "\"Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton\r\nRoad. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course\r\nof which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the\r\nstomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night\r\nwas so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of\r\nhis victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and\r\nthe writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks\r\nto throw the police on to the wrong scent.\"",
    "\"Well done!\" said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \"Really, Gregson, you\r\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\"",
    "\"I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\" the detective\r\nanswered proudly. \"The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\r\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\r\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\r\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\r\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\r\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is\r\nto think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am\r\nafraid he won't make much of it. Why, by Jove, here's the very man\r\nhimself!\"",
    "It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\r\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\r\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\r\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\r\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with\r\nSherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\r\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\r\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \"This is a most\r\nextraordinary case,\" he said at last-\"a most incomprehensible affair.\"",
    "\"Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\" cried Gregson, triumphantly. \"I\r\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\r\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\"",
    "\"The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\" said Lestrade gravely, \"was\r\nmurdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning.\"",
    ".\r\nLIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.",
    "The intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\r\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\r\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\r\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and\r\nhis brows drawn down over his eyes.",
    "\"Stangerson too!\" he muttered. \"The plot thickens.\"",
    "\"It was quite thick enough before,\" grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\r\n\"I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\"",
    "\"Are you-are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\" stammered\r\nGregson.",
    "\"I have just come from his room,\" said Lestrade. \"I was the first to\r\ndiscover what had occurred.\"",
    "\"We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,\" Holmes observed.\r\n\"Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\"",
    "\"I have no objection,\" Lestrade answered, seating himself. \"I freely\r\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the\r\ndeath of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\r\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\r\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\r\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in\r\nthe morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question\r\nwhich confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed\r\nbetween 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him\r\nafterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the\r\nman, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\r\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the\r\nvicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion\r\nhad become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put\r\nup somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the\r\nstation again next morning.\"",
    "\"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\"\r\nremarked Holmes.",
    "\"So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\r\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\r\nat eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George\r\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\r\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.",
    "\"'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,' they said. 'He\r\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.'",
    "\"'Where is he now?' I asked.",
    "\"'He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.'",
    "\"'I will go up and see him at once,' I said.",
    "\"It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\r\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\r\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\r\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about\r\nto go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish,\r\nin spite of my twenty years' experience. From under the door there\r\ncurled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the\r\npassage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.\r\nI gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he\r\nsaw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to\r\nit, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the\r\nwindow, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was\r\nquite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and\r\ncold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as\r\nbeing the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of\r\nJoseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side,\r\nwhich must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part\r\nof the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\"",
    "I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\r\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.",
    "\"The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\" he said.",
    "\"That was it,\" said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\r\nsilent for a while.",
    "There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\r\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\r\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\r\ntingled as I thought of it.",
    "\"The man was seen,\" continued Lestrade. \"A milk boy, passing on his way\r\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\r\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\r\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\r\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\r\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\r\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\r\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for\r\nhim to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a\r\nreddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have\r\nstayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found\r\nblood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and\r\nmarks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\"",
    "I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\r\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\r\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.",
    "\"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\r\nmurderer?\" he asked.",
    "\"Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems\r\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\r\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\r\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\r\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single\r\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the\r\nwords, 'J. H. is in Europe.' There was no name appended to this\r\nmessage.\"",
    "\"And there was nothing else?\" Holmes asked.",
    "\"Nothing of any importance. The man's novel, with which he had read\r\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\r\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\r\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\"",
    "Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.",
    "\"The last link,\" he cried, exultantly. \"My case is complete.\"",
    "The two detectives stared at him in amazement.",
    "\"I have now in my hands,\" my companion said, confidently, \"all the\r\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\r\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\r\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\r\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\r\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\r\nupon those pills?\"",
    "\"I have them,\" said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \"I took them\r\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place\r\nof safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking\r\nthese pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance\r\nto them.\"",
    "\"Give them here,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Doctor,\" turning to me, \"are those\r\nordinary pills?\"",
    "They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\r\nround, and almost transparent against the light. \"From their lightness\r\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\" I\r\nremarked.",
    "\"Precisely so,\" answered Holmes. \"Now would you mind going down and\r\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so\r\nlong, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain\r\nyesterday.\"",
    "I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms. Its laboured\r\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\r\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\r\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\r\nrug.",
    "\"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing\r\nhis penknife he suited the action to the word. \"One half we return into\r\nthe box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine\r\nglass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\r\nfriend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\"",
    "\"This may be very interesting,\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\r\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, \"I cannot see, however,\r\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\"",
    "\"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\r\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\r\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\r\nit up readily enough.\"",
    "As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\r\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\r\nHolmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\r\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\r\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\r\nupon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither\r\nthe better nor the worse for its draught.",
    "Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\r\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\r\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\r\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was\r\nhis emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\r\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check\r\nwhich he had met.",
    "\"It can't be a coincidence,\" he cried, at last springing from his chair\r\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; \"it is impossible that it\r\nshould be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the\r\ncase of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And\r\nyet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\r\nreasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\r\nwretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\" With a\r\nperfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\r\ntwo, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\r\nunfortunate creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\r\nit before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\r\nand lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.",
    "Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\r\nforehead. \"I should have more faith,\" he said; \"I ought to know by this\r\ntime that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\r\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\r\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\r\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\r\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.\"",
    "This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\r\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\r\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\r\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\r\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.",
    "\"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you failed\r\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\r\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\r\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\r\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\r\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\r\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\r\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\r\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\r\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\r\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\r\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those\r\n_outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it\r\nremarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\r\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\"",
    "Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\r\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\r\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\r\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\r\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\r\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\r\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\r\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\r\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\r\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\r\nman who did it?\"",
    "\"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked Lestrade.\r\n\"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\r\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\r\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\"",
    "\"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him time\r\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"",
    "Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\r\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\r\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.",
    "\"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly and\r\nfacing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question. You\r\nhave asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\r\nknowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power\r\nof laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have\r\ngood hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a\r\nthing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate\r\nman to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by\r\nanother who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea\r\nthat anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but\r\nif he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish\r\nin an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.\r\nWithout meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that\r\nI consider these men to be more than a match for the official force,\r\nand that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of\r\ncourse, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am\r\nprepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I\r\ncan communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I\r\nshall do so.\"",
    "Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\r\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\r\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other's beady\r\neyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time\r\nto speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the\r\nspokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his\r\ninsignificant and unsavoury person.",
    "\"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab\r\ndownstairs.\"",
    "\"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don't you introduce this pattern\r\nat Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\r\na drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\r\ninstant.\"",
    "\"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only\r\nfind the man to put them on.\"",
    "\"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well\r\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"",
    "I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\r\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\r\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\r\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\r\nroom.",
    "\"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling over\r\nhis task, and never turning his head.",
    "The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\r\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\r\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.",
    "\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\r\nStangerson.\"",
    "The whole thing occurred in a moment-so quickly that I had no time to\r\nrealize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes'\r\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman's dazed,\r\nsavage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\r\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\r\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\r\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled\r\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\r\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\r\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and\r\nthen commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he,\r\nthat the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to\r\nhave the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and\r\nhands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss\r\nof blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\r\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\r\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\r\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\r\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless\r\nand panting.",
    "\"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It will serve to take him to\r\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\" he continued, with a pleasant\r\nsmile, \"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\r\nwelcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\r\ndanger that I will refuse to answer them.\"",
    ".\r\nON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.",
    "In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\r\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\r\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\r\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\r\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\r\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\r\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\r\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are\r\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\r\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the\r\ncommon characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.",
    "There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or\r\nof Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\r\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\r\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\r\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\r\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\r\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.\r\nThese are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.",
    "In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the\r\nnorthern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\r\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\r\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\r\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\r\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\r\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\r\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\r\ngrey earth-above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\r\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing\r\nbut silence-complete and heart-subduing silence.",
    "It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\r\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\r\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\r\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\r\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\r\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\r\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\r\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\r\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\r\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of\r\nthose who had fallen by the wayside.",
    "Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\r\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the\r\nregion. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was\r\nnearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the\r\nbrown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;\r\nhis long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;\r\nhis eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre;\r\nwhile the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that\r\nof a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and\r\nyet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a\r\nwiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his\r\nclothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed\r\nwhat it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man\r\nwas dying-dying from hunger and from thirst.",
    "He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\r\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\r\ngreat salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\r\nsavage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\r\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\r\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\r\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\r\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \"Why\r\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\" he\r\nmuttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.",
    "Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\r\nrifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\r\ncarried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\r\nheavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground\r\nwith some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a\r\nlittle moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face,\r\nwith very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.",
    "\"You've hurt me!\" said a childish voice reproachfully.",
    "\"Have I though,\" the man answered penitently, \"I didn't go for to do\r\nit.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\r\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\r\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care. The\r\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\r\nhad suffered less than her companion.",
    "\"How is it now?\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\r\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.",
    "\"Kiss it and make it well,\" she said, with perfect gravity, showing the\r\ninjured part up to him. \"That's what mother used to do. Where's\r\nmother?\"",
    "\"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.\"",
    "\"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she\r\n'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and\r\nnow she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't\r\nthere no water, nor nothing to eat?\"",
    "\"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient\r\nawhile, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\r\nthat, and then you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your\r\nlips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards\r\nlie. What's that you've got?\"",
    "\"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,\r\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to home\r\nI'll give them to brother Bob.\"",
    "\"You'll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man confidently.\r\n\"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though-you remember when\r\nwe left the river?\"",
    "\"Oh, yes.\"",
    "\"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But there\r\nwas somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't\r\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\r\nand-and--\"",
    "\"And you couldn't wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely,\r\nstaring up at his grimy visage.",
    "\"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\r\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\r\nyour mother.\"",
    "\"Then mother's a deader too,\" cried the little girl dropping her face\r\nin her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.",
    "\"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\r\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\r\nwe tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters.\r\nThere's an almighty small chance for us now!\"",
    "\"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking\r\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.",
    "\"I guess that's about the size of it.\"",
    "\"Why didn't you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You gave\r\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with\r\nmother again.\"",
    "\"Yes, you will, dearie.\"",
    "\"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she\r\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\r\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\r\nfond of. How long will it be first?\"",
    "\"I don't know-not very long.\" The man's eyes were fixed upon the\r\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\r\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\r\ndid they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\r\nbrown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\r\nthen settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards,\r\nthe vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.",
    "\"Cocks and hens,\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\r\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \"Say, did\r\nGod make this country?\"",
    "\"In course He did,\" said her companion, rather startled by this\r\nunexpected question.",
    "\"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\" the\r\nlittle girl continued. \"I guess somebody else made the country in these\r\nparts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\r\ntrees.\"",
    "\"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\" the man asked diffidently.",
    "\"It ain't night yet,\" she answered.",
    "\"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you\r\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\r\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.\"",
    "\"Why don't you say some yourself?\" the child asked, with wondering\r\neyes.",
    "\"I disremember them,\" he answered. \"I hain't said none since I was half\r\nthe height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out,\r\nand I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.\"",
    "\"Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,\" she said, laying the\r\nshawl out for that purpose. \"You've got to put your hands up like this.\r\nIt makes you feel kind o' good.\"",
    "It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\r\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\r\nlittle prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\r\nchubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the\r\ncloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom\r\nthey were face to face, while the two voices-the one thin and clear,\r\nthe other deep and harsh-united in the entreaty for mercy and\r\nforgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow\r\nof the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad\r\nbreast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but\r\nNature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights\r\nhe had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids\r\ndrooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the\r\nbreast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses\r\nof his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.",
    "Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\r\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\r\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\r\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\r\ngradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\r\nwell-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\r\nbecame evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\r\nmoving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to\r\nthe conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon\r\nthe prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in\r\nthese arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary\r\nbluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered\r\ntilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up\r\nthrough the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great\r\ncaravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the\r\nhead of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet\r\nvisible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the\r\nstraggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.\r\nInnumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who\r\ntoddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white\r\ncoverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but\r\nrather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of\r\ncircumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the\r\nclear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of\r\nhumanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud\r\nas it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above\r\nthem.",
    "At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\r\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On\r\nreaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council\r\namong themselves.",
    "\"The wells are to the right, my brothers,\" said one, a hard-lipped,\r\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.",
    "\"To the right of the Sierra Blanco-so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\"\r\nsaid another.",
    "\"Fear not for water,\" cried a third. \"He who could draw it from the\r\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\"",
    "\"Amen! Amen!\" responded the whole party.",
    "They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\r\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\r\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\r\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\r\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\r\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\r\n'Redskins' was on every lip.",
    "\"There can't be any number of Injuns here,\" said the elderly man who\r\nappeared to be in command. \"We have passed the Pawnees, and there are\r\nno other tribes until we cross the great mountains.\"",
    "\"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\" asked one of the\r\nband.",
    "\"And I,\" \"and I,\" cried a dozen voices.",
    "\"Leave your horses below and we will await you here,\" the Elder\r\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\r\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\r\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\r\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The\r\nwatchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\r\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who\r\nhad first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw\r\nhim throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on\r\njoining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met\r\ntheir eyes.",
    "On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\r\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\r\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His\r\nplacid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.\r\nBeside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his\r\nbrown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast\r\nof his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular\r\nline of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her\r\ninfantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white\r\nsocks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast\r\nto the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock\r\nabove this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at\r\nthe sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment\r\nand flapped sullenly away.",
    "The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about\r\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down\r\nupon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him,\r\nand which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.\r\nHis face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he\r\npassed his boney hand over his eyes. \"This is what they call delirium,\r\nI guess,\" he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the\r\nskirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the\r\nwondering questioning gaze of childhood.",
    "The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways\r\nthat their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little\r\ngirl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her\r\ngaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.",
    "\"My name is John Ferrier,\" the wanderer explained; \"me and that little\r\nun are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o'\r\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.\"",
    "\"Is she your child?\" asked someone.",
    "\"I guess she is now,\" the other cried, defiantly; \"she's mine 'cause I\r\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from this\r\nday on. Who are you, though?\" he continued, glancing with curiosity at\r\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \"there seems to be a powerful lot of\r\nye.\"",
    "\"Nigh upon ten thousand,\" said one of the young men; \"we are the\r\npersecuted children of God-the chosen of the Angel Merona.\"",
    "\"I never heard tell on him,\" said the wanderer. \"He appears to have\r\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.\"",
    "\"Do not jest at that which is sacred,\" said the other sternly. \"We are\r\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian\r\nletters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy\r\nJoseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of\r\nIllinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a\r\nrefuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the\r\nheart of the desert.\"",
    "The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \"I\r\nsee,\" he said, \"you are the Mormons.\"",
    "\"We are the Mormons,\" answered his companions with one voice.",
    "\"And where are you going?\"",
    "\"We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\r\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\r\nyou.\"",
    "They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\r\nby crowds of the pilgrims-pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\r\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of\r\nastonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\r\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\r\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a\r\ngreat crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\r\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\r\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\r\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\r\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\r\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\r\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\r\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then\r\nhe turned to the two castaways.",
    "\"If we take you with us,\" he said, in solemn words, \"it can only be as\r\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\r\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\r\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts\r\nthe whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\"",
    "\"Guess I'll come with you on any terms,\" said Ferrier, with such\r\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\r\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.",
    "\"Take him, Brother Stangerson,\" he said, \"give him food and drink, and\r\nthe child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\r\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\"",
    "\"On, on to Zion!\" cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled\r\ndown the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away\r\nin a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a\r\ncreaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the\r\nwhole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the\r\ntwo waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was\r\nalready awaiting them.",
    "\"You shall remain here,\" he said. \"In a few days you will have\r\nrecovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and\r\nfor ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has\r\nspoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\"",
    ".\r\nTHE FLOWER OF UTAH.",
    "This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\r\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From\r\nthe shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky\r\nMountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in\r\nhistory. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue,\r\nand disease-every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had\r\nall been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and\r\nthe accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among\r\nthem. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt\r\nprayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight\r\nbeneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was\r\nthe promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\r\nevermore.",
    "Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as\r\na resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the\r\nfuture city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and\r\nallotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The\r\ntradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the\r\ntown streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country\r\nthere was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next\r\nsummer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything\r\nprospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which\r\nthey had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\r\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the\r\nclatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the\r\nmonument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe\r\nthrough many dangers.",
    "The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\r\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\r\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\r\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat which\r\nshe shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his son, a headstrong\r\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of\r\nchildhood, from the shock caused by her mother's death, she soon became\r\na pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her\r\nmoving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered\r\nfrom his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an\r\nindefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new\r\ncompanions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was\r\nunanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as\r\nfertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of\r\nYoung himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who\r\nwere the four principal Elders.",
    "On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\r\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\r\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen\r\nin his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\r\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\r\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him\r\nprospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\r\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in\r\ntwelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\r\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant\r\nWahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John\r\nFerrier.",
    "There was one way and only one in which he offended the\r\nsusceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion\r\ncould ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner\r\nof his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal,\r\nbut contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his\r\ndetermination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his\r\nadopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and\r\nreluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love\r\naffair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of\r\nthe Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate.\r\nIn every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young\r\nsettlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and\r\nstraight-walking man.",
    "Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\r\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\r\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\r\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\r\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\r\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\r\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\r\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang,\r\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the\r\nWest. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her\r\nfather the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of\r\nAmerican girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.",
    "It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\r\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\r\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\r\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\r\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\r\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\r\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and\r\nremember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.\r\nIn the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself,\r\napart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many\r\nbesides.",
    "It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\r\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields\r\nand in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty\r\nhigh roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to\r\nthe west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the\r\nOverland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were\r\ndroves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands,\r\nand trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their\r\ninterminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her\r\nway with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\r\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut\r\nhair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in\r\nthe City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with\r\nall the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was\r\nto be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in\r\nastonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with\r\ntheir pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at\r\nthe beauty of the pale-faced maiden.",
    "She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\r\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\r\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass\r\nthis obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.\r\nScarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed\r\nin behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving\r\nstream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to\r\ndeal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took\r\nadvantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of\r\npushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\r\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact\r\nwith the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant\r\nit reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and\r\ntossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.\r\nThe situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse\r\nbrought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It\r\nwas all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a\r\nslip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and\r\nterrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began\r\nto swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising\r\ncloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might\r\nhave abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her\r\nelbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy\r\nbrown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way\r\nthrough the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.",
    "\"You're not hurt, I hope, miss,\" said her preserver, respectfully.",
    "She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \"I'm awful\r\nfrightened,\" she said, naively; \"whoever would have thought that Poncho\r\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?\"",
    "\"Thank God you kept your seat,\" the other said earnestly. He was a\r\ntall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,\r\nand clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over\r\nhis shoulders. \"I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\" he\r\nremarked, \"I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask\r\nhim if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he's the same\r\nFerrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\"",
    "\"Hadn't you better come and ask yourself?\" she asked, demurely.",
    "The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\r\nsparkled with pleasure. \"I'll do so,\" he said, \"we've been in the\r\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\r\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.\"",
    "\"He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\" she answered,\r\n\"he's awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he'd have never\r\ngot over it.\"",
    "\"Neither would I,\" said her companion.",
    "\"You! Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\r\nYou ain't even a friend of ours.\"",
    "The young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\r\nFerrier laughed aloud.",
    "\"There, I didn't mean that,\" she said; \"of course, you are a friend\r\nnow. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won't\r\ntrust me with his business any more. Good-bye!\"",
    "\"Good-bye,\" he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\r\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\r\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\r\ndust.",
    "Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\r\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\r\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\r\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as\r\nkeen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had\r\ndrawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young\r\ngirl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his\r\nvolcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from\r\nhis sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that\r\nneither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of\r\nsuch importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love\r\nwhich had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy\r\nof a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will\r\nand imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he\r\nundertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if\r\nhuman effort and human perseverance could render him successful.",
    "He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his\r\nface was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\r\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the\r\nnews of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\r\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\r\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\r\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in\r\nthose wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\r\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to\r\nbe had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became\r\na favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues.\r\nOn such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her\r\nbright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no\r\nlonger her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\r\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\r\naffections.",
    "It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\r\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\r\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.",
    "\"I am off, Lucy,\" he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\r\ntenderly down into her face; \"I won't ask you to come with me now, but\r\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?\"",
    "\"And when will that be?\" she asked, blushing and laughing.",
    "\"A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\r\ndarling. There's no one who can stand between us.\"",
    "\"And how about father?\" she asked.",
    "\"He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\r\nright. I have no fear on that head.\"",
    "\"Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's\r\nno more to be said,\" she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\r\nbreast.",
    "\"Thank God!\" he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \"It is\r\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\r\nwaiting for me at the ca\u00f1on. Good-bye, my own darling-good-bye. In two\r\nmonths you shall see me.\"",
    "He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\r\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\r\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what\r\nhe was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he\r\nvanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\r\nhappiest girl in all Utah.",
    ".\r\nJOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.",
    "Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\r\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier's heart was sore within him\r\nwhen he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending loss of\r\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the\r\narrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\r\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\r\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\r\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\r\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\r\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\r\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\r\nthe Land of the Saints.",
    "Yes, a dangerous matter-so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\r\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\r\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\r\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\r\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible\r\ndescription. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\r\nVehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\r\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\r\nthe State of Utah.",
    "Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\r\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\r\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\r\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\r\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\r\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands\r\nof his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by\r\nannihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\r\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went\r\nabout in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\r\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.",
    "At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\r\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\r\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\r\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\r\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\r\nrumours began to be bandied about-rumours of murdered immigrants and\r\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\r\nappeared in the harems of the Elders-women who pined and wept, and bore\r\nupon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\r\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\r\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\r\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\r\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\r\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\r\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.",
    "Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\r\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\r\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\r\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\r\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\r\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\r\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\r\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\r\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\r\nnearest his heart.",
    "One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\r\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\r\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\r\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great\r\nBrigham Young himself. Full of trepidation-for he knew that such a\r\nvisit boded him little good-Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon\r\nchief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and\r\nfollowed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.",
    "\"Brother Ferrier,\" he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\r\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, \"the true believers have been\r\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\r\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\r\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\r\nprotection. Is not this so?\"",
    "\"It is so,\" answered John Ferrier.",
    "\"In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\r\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\r\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you\r\nhave neglected.\"",
    "\"And how have I neglected it?\" asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\r\nexpostulation. \"Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not\r\nattended at the Temple? Have I not--?\"",
    "\"Where are your wives?\" asked Young, looking round him. \"Call them in,\r\nthat I may greet them.\"",
    "\"It is true that I have not married,\" Ferrier answered. \"But women were\r\nfew, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\r\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\"",
    "\"It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\" said the leader of\r\nthe Mormons. \"She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\r\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\"",
    "John Ferrier groaned internally.",
    "\"There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve-stories that\r\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\r\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\r\n'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she\r\nwed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.' This being so, it is\r\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\r\ndaughter to violate it.\"",
    "John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\r\nriding-whip.",
    "\"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested-so it has been\r\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\r\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\r\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be\r\nprovided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\r\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\r\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\r\nyou to that?\"",
    "[1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred\r\n    wives under this endearing epithet.",
    "Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.",
    "\"You will give us time,\" he said at last. \"My daughter is very\r\nyoung-she is scarce of an age to marry.\"",
    "\"She shall have a month to choose,\" said Young, rising from his seat.\r\n\"At the end of that time she shall give her answer.\"",
    "He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\r\nflashing eyes. \"It were better for you, John Ferrier,\" he thundered,\r\n\"that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\r\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\r\nthe Holy Four!\"",
    "With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\r\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.",
    "He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\r\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\r\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\r\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.",
    "\"I could not help it,\" she said, in answer to his look. \"His voice rang\r\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\"",
    "\"Don't you scare yourself,\" he answered, drawing her to him, and\r\npassing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.\r\n\"We'll fix it up somehow or another. You don't find your fancy kind o'\r\nlessening for this chap, do you?\"",
    "A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.",
    "\"No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. He's a\r\nlikely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folk here,\r\nin spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party starting\r\nfor Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him\r\nknow the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be\r\nback here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\"",
    "Lucy laughed through her tears at her father's description.",
    "\"When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\r\nI am frightened, dear. One hears-one hears such dreadful stories about\r\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\r\nthem.\"",
    "\"But we haven't opposed him yet,\" her father answered. \"It will be time\r\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\r\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\"",
    "\"Leave Utah!\"",
    "\"That's about the size of it.\"",
    "\"But the farm?\"",
    "\"We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\r\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. I\r\ndon't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\r\ndarned prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to me. Guess\r\nI'm too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\r\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the\r\nopposite direction.\"",
    "\"But they won't let us leave,\" his daughter objected.",
    "\"Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. In the\r\nmeantime, don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes\r\nswelled up, else he'll be walking into me when he sees you. There's\r\nnothing to be afeared about, and there's no danger at all.\"",
    "John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\r\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\r\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\r\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.",
    ".\r\nA FLIGHT FOR LIFE.",
    "On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\r\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\r\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\r\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\r\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\r\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and\r\nreturned home with a lighter heart.",
    "As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\r\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\r\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\r\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\r\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\r\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\r\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\r\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the\r\nconversation.",
    "\"Maybe you don't know us,\" he said. \"This here is the son of Elder\r\nDrebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\r\ndesert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\r\ntrue fold.\"",
    "\"As He will all the nations in His own good time,\" said the other in a\r\nnasal voice; \"He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\"",
    "John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.",
    "\"We have come,\" continued Stangerson, \"at the advice of our fathers to\r\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\r\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\r\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\"",
    "\"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\" cried the other; \"the question is not\r\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\r\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\"",
    "\"But my prospects are better,\" said the other, warmly. \"When the Lord\r\nremoves my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\r\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\"",
    "\"It will be for the maiden to decide,\" rejoined young Drebber, smirking\r\nat his own reflection in the glass. \"We will leave it all to her\r\ndecision.\"",
    "During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\r\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.",
    "\"Look here,\" he said at last, striding up to them, \"when my daughter\r\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your\r\nfaces again.\"",
    "The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\r\ncompetition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of\r\nhonours both to her and her father.",
    "\"There are two ways out of the room,\" cried Ferrier; \"there is the\r\ndoor, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\"",
    "His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\r\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\r\nold farmer followed them to the door.",
    "\"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,\" he said,\r\nsardonically.",
    "\"You shall smart for this!\" Stangerson cried, white with rage. \"You\r\nhave defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\r\nthe end of your days.\"",
    "\"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\" cried young Drebber;\r\n\"He will arise and smite you!\"",
    "\"Then I'll start the smiting,\" exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\r\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\r\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses'\r\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.",
    "\"The young canting rascals!\" he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead; \"I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\r\nwife of either of them.\"",
    "\"And so should I, father,\" she answered, with spirit; \"but Jefferson\r\nwill soon be here.\"",
    "\"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\r\nwe do not know what their next move may be.\"",
    "It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\r\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\r\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\r\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\r\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\r\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\r\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\r\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\r\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\r\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this\r\nsuspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\r\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\r\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.",
    "He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\r\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\r\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\r\nsurprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed\r\njust over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-",
    "\"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then--\"",
    "The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\r\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\r\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\r\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\r\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\r\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\r\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\r\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\r\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.",
    "Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\r\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\r\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the\r\nnumber 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\r\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\r\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\r\nhad been painted upon the outside of his door.",
    "Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\r\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\r\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\r\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\r\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\r\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\r\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\r\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\r\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled\r\nlook of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that\r\nwas for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.",
    "Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\r\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\r\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\r\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\r\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\r\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\r\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\r\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\r\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\r\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\r\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\r\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life\r\nitself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter's\r\ndishonour.",
    "He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\r\nand searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\r\nthe figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the\r\nlast of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague\r\nand terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter-what was\r\nto become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the\r\ninvisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon\r\nthe table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.",
    "What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound-low,\r\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\r\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was\r\na pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\r\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\r\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\r\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\r\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\r\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\r\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt\r\nand threw the door open.",
    "Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\r\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\r\nfarmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\r\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\r\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\r\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\r\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.",
    "So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\r\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\r\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\r\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into\r\nthe hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within\r\nthe house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to\r\nthe astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of\r\nJefferson Hope.",
    "\"Good God!\" gasped John Ferrier. \"How you scared me! Whatever made you\r\ncome in like that.\"",
    "\"Give me food,\" the other said, hoarsely. \"I have had no time for bite\r\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.\" He flung himself upon the cold meat\r\nand bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's supper,\r\nand devoured it voraciously. \"Does Lucy bear up well?\" he asked, when\r\nhe had satisfied his hunger.",
    "\"Yes. She does not know the danger,\" her father answered.",
    "\"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\r\ncrawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not\r\nquite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\"",
    "John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\r\ndevoted ally. He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it\r\ncordially. \"You're a man to be proud of,\" he said. \"There are not many\r\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.\"",
    "\"You've hit it there, pard,\" the young hunter answered. \"I have a\r\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice\r\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that brings\r\nme here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o'\r\nthe Hope family in Utah.\"",
    "\"What are we to do?\"",
    "\"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\r\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much\r\nmoney have you?\"",
    "\"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\"",
    "\"That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for\r\nCarson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as\r\nwell that the servants do not sleep in the house.\"",
    "While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\r\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\r\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\r\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\r\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\r\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\r\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\r\nmuch to be done.",
    "\"We must make our start at once,\" said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\r\nlow but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\r\nperil, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \"The front and back\r\nentrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\r\nside window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\r\nmiles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we\r\nshould be half-way through the mountains.\"",
    "\"What if we are stopped,\" asked Ferrier.",
    "Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\r\ntunic. \"If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\r\nwith us,\" he said with a sinister smile.",
    "The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\r\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\r\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\r\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\r\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\r\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\r\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the\r\nspirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\r\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\r\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.",
    "Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the\r\nscanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a\r\nfew of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\r\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\r\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\r\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\r\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\r\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\r\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\r\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.",
    "It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\r\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\r\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of\r\nthem, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\r\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\r\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal\r\ncry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.",
    "\"To-morrow at midnight,\" said the first who appeared to be in\r\nauthority. \"When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\"",
    "\"It is well,\" returned the other. \"Shall I tell Brother Drebber?\"",
    "\"Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\"",
    "\"Seven to five!\" repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\r\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\r\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\r\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping\r\nhis companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the\r\ntop of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her\r\nstrength appeared to fail her.",
    "\"Hurry on! hurry on!\" he gasped from time to time. \"We are through the\r\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\"",
    "Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet\r\nanyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\r\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\r\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\r\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\r\nbetween them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting\r\nthem. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the\r\ngreat boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he\r\ncame to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful\r\nanimals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old\r\nFerrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson\r\nHope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.",
    "It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\r\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\r\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\r\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified\r\nmonster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all\r\nadvance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow\r\nin places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that\r\nonly practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of\r\nall dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light\r\nwithin them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\r\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.",
    "They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\r\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\r\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\r\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\r\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\r\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \"Who goes\r\nthere?\" rang through the silent ravine.",
    "\"Travellers for Nevada,\" said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\r\nrifle which hung by his saddle.",
    "They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down\r\nat them as if dissatisfied at their reply.",
    "\"By whose permission?\" he asked.",
    "\"The Holy Four,\" answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught\r\nhim that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.",
    "\"Nine from seven,\" cried the sentinel.",
    "\"Seven from five,\" returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\r\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.",
    "\"Pass, and the Lord go with you,\" said the voice from above. Beyond his\r\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\r\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\r\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\r\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.",
    ".\r\nTHE AVENGING ANGELS.",
    "All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\r\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope's\r\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\r\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\r\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\r\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon.\r\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\r\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only\r\na gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear\r\nentirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with\r\ntrees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they\r\npassed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which\r\nwoke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses\r\ninto a gallop.",
    "As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\r\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\r\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\r\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\r\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered\r\ntheir horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her\r\nfather would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\r\ninexorable. \"They will be upon our track by this time,\" he said.\r\n\"Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for\r\nthe remainder of our lives.\"",
    "During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\r\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\r\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\r\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\r\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. Before\r\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\r\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\r\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\r\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\r\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.",
    "About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\r\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\r\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\r\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\r\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\r\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\r\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the\r\nair was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy\r\nadieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of\r\nwhatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man\r\nand the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three\r\nanimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks\r\nhid them from his view.",
    "He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\r\nwithout success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and\r\nother indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the\r\nvicinity. At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he was\r\nthinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he\r\nsaw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the\r\nedge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there\r\nstood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed\r\nwith a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn-for so it is called-was\r\nacting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to\r\nthe hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction,\r\nand had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon\r\na rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\r\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\r\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.",
    "The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\r\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\r\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening\r\nwas already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he\r\nrealized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had\r\nwandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no\r\neasy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in\r\nwhich he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which\r\nwere so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from\r\nthe other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a\r\nmountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before.\r\nConvinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with\r\nthe same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark\r\nbefore he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.\r\nEven then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the\r\nmoon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the\r\nobscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from\r\nhis exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the\r\nreflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he\r\ncarried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their\r\njourney.",
    "He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\r\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\r\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\r\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\r\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud\r\nhalloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an\r\nanswer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary\r\nsilent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless\r\nrepetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no\r\nwhisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time\r\nago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards\r\nfrantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.",
    "When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\r\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\r\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead\r\nsilence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\r\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\r\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\r\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\r\nhis absence-a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\r\ntraces behind it.",
    "Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\r\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\r\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\r\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\r\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\r\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\r\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the\r\nfugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\r\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\r\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\r\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which\r\nmade every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one\r\nside of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had\r\nassuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything\r\nbut a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived\r\nthat a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the\r\ncleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the\r\npoint:",
    "JOHN FERRIER,\r\nFORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,\r\nDied August 4th, 1860.",
    "The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\r\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\r\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\r\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\r\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder's son. As the young\r\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\r\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in\r\nhis last silent resting-place.",
    "Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\r\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\r\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\r\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness,\r\nwhich he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived.\r\nAs he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which\r\ncould assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution,\r\nbrought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring\r\nenergy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim,\r\nwhite face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and\r\nhaving stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him\r\nfor a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\r\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\r\navenging angels.",
    "For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\r\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\r\namong the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak\r\nhe was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle\r\nCa\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he\r\ncould look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he\r\nleaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\r\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there\r\nwere flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\r\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\r\nheard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\r\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named\r\nCowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He\r\ntherefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of\r\nfinding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.",
    "\"I am Jefferson Hope,\" he said. \"You remember me.\"",
    "The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment-indeed, it was\r\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\r\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\r\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\r\nthe man's surprise changed to consternation.",
    "\"You are mad to come here,\" he cried. \"It is as much as my own life is\r\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\r\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\"",
    "\"I don't fear them, or their warrant,\" Hope said, earnestly. \"You must\r\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\r\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\r\nGod's sake, don't refuse to answer me.\"",
    "\"What is it?\" the Mormon asked uneasily. \"Be quick. The very rocks have\r\nears and the trees eyes.\"",
    "\"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?\"",
    "\"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\r\nhave no life left in you.\"",
    "\"Don't mind me,\" said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\r\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \"Married,\r\nyou say?\"",
    "\"Married yesterday-that's what those flags are for on the Endowment\r\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\r\nas to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party that\r\nfollowed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give\r\nhim the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's\r\nparty was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one\r\nwon't have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.\r\nShe is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\"",
    "\"Yes, I am off,\" said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\r\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\r\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.",
    "\"Where are you going?\"",
    "\"Never mind,\" he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\r\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains\r\nto the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so\r\nfierce and so dangerous as himself.",
    "The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\r\nwas the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\r\nmarriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\r\nhead again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\r\nhusband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier's\r\nproperty, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his\r\nother wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the\r\nburial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in\r\nthe early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\r\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking,\r\nweather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a\r\nglance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white\r\nsilent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.\r\nStooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead,\r\nand then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her\r\nfinger. \"She shall not be buried in that,\" he cried with a fierce\r\nsnarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and\r\nwas gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers\r\nmight have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other\r\npeople of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet\r\nof gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.",
    "For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a\r\nstrange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\r\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\r\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the\r\nlonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's\r\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\r\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\r\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\r\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\r\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\r\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\r\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\r\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\r\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\r\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\r\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.",
    "Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's mind\r\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\r\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any\r\nother emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\r\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\r\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome\r\nfood were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains,\r\nwhat was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure\r\nto overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his\r\nenemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there\r\nto recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue\r\nhis object without privation.",
    "His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\r\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\r\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his\r\nwrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\r\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave. Disguised,\r\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what\r\nbecame of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be\r\njustice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\r\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\r\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\r\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of\r\nthe malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had\r\nbeen Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.\r\nRumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\r\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\r\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at\r\nall, however, as to their whereabouts.",
    "Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\r\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\r\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\r\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\r\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\r\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\r\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\r\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but\r\na glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\r\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\r\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\r\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\r\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his\r\neyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\r\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\r\nhim that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\r\nhatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\r\ncustody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\r\nweeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\r\nDrebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\r\ndeparted for Europe.",
    "Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\r\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for\r\nsome time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\r\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\r\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city,\r\nworking his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\r\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\r\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\r\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\r\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\r\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\r\nquote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson's\r\nJournal, to which we are already under such obligations.",
    ".\r\nA CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.",
    "Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\r\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\r\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\r\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \"I guess you're going to take\r\nme to the police-station,\" he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \"My cab's at\r\nthe door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it. I'm not so\r\nlight to lift as I used to be.\"",
    "Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\r\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\r\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles.\r\nHe rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they\r\nwere free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\r\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\r\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\r\nas formidable as his personal strength.",
    "\"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are\r\nthe man for it,\" he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\r\nfellow-lodger. \"The way you kept on my trail was a caution.\"",
    "\"You had better come with me,\" said Holmes to the two detectives.",
    "\"I can drive you,\" said Lestrade.",
    "\"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\r\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\"",
    "I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\r\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\r\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse,\r\nand brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered\r\ninto a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner's\r\nname and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged.\r\nThe official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\r\nduties in a dull mechanical way. \"The prisoner will be put before the\r\nmagistrates in the course of the week,\" he said; \"in the mean time, Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\r\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\"",
    "\"I've got a good deal to say,\" our prisoner said slowly. \"I want to\r\ntell you gentlemen all about it.\"",
    "\"Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?\" asked the Inspector.",
    "\"I may never be tried,\" he answered. \"You needn't look startled. It\r\nisn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\" He turned his fierce\r\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.",
    "\"Yes; I am,\" I answered.",
    "\"Then put your hand here,\" he said, with a smile, motioning with his\r\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.",
    "I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing\r\nand commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed\r\nto thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some\r\npowerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a\r\ndull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.",
    "\"Why,\" I cried, \"you have an aortic aneurism!\"",
    "\"That's what they call it,\" he said, placidly. \"I went to a Doctor last\r\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many\r\ndays passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from\r\nover-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've\r\ndone my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to\r\nleave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be\r\nremembered as a common cut-throat.\"",
    "The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\r\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.",
    "\"Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\" the former\r\nasked.",
    "\"Most certainly there is,\" I answered.",
    "\"In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\r\ntake his statement,\" said the Inspector. \"You are at liberty, sir, to\r\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\"",
    "\"I'll sit down, with your leave,\" the prisoner said, suiting the action\r\nto the word. \"This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\r\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the brink\r\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is\r\nthe absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to\r\nme.\"",
    "With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\r\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\r\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\r\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\r\naccess to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's words were\r\ntaken down exactly as they were uttered.",
    "\"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,\" he said; \"it's\r\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings-a father\r\nand a daughter-and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.\r\nAfter the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\r\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\r\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\r\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done the same, if\r\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.",
    "\"That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\r\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\r\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\r\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\r\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it\r\nabout with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\r\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\r\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\r\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\r\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.",
    "\"They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\r\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\r\nfound that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and\r\nriding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner's\r\noffice, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to\r\nthe owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There\r\nwas seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The\r\nhardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the\r\nmazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\r\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal\r\nhotels and stations, I got on pretty well.",
    "\"It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were\r\nliving; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across\r\nthem. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other\r\nside of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at\r\nmy mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their\r\nrecognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my\r\nopportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.",
    "\"They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\r\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\r\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\r\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at\r\nnight that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\r\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\r\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.",
    "\"They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\r\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\r\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\r\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\r\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\r\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\r\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\r\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\r\nand leave my work undone.",
    "\"At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\r\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\r\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\r\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my\r\nhorse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I\r\nfeared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station\r\nthey got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on\r\nto the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the\r\nguard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for\r\nsome hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was\r\nrather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle\r\nthat I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said\r\nthat he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other\r\nwould wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated\r\nwith him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together.\r\nDrebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must\r\ngo alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other\r\nburst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his\r\npaid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that\r\nthe Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him\r\nthat if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's\r\nPrivate Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the\r\nplatform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.",
    "\"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\r\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but\r\nsingly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\r\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction\r\nin vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that\r\nstrikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans\r\narranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who\r\nhad wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\r\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in\r\nlooking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one\r\nof them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;\r\nbut in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate\r\nconstructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this\r\ngreat city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to\r\nget Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to\r\nsolve.",
    "\"He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\r\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\r\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\r\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\r\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole\r\nway. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets,\r\nuntil, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in\r\nwhich he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in\r\nreturning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or\r\nso from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a\r\nglass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\"",
    "I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.",
    "\"That's better,\" he said. \"Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\r\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside\r\nthe house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared,\r\none of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had\r\nnever seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they\r\ncame to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent\r\nhim half across the road. 'You hound,' he cried, shaking his stick at\r\nhim; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!' He was so hot that I\r\nthink he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur\r\nstaggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He\r\nran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and\r\njumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he.",
    "\"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\r\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\r\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\r\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\r\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when\r\nhe solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again,\r\nand he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving\r\nword that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time,\r\nand when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my\r\nown hands.",
    "\"Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\r\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\r\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\r\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\r\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\r\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor\r\nwas lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as\r\nhe called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\r\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\r\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and\r\nwhen they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a\r\nfairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble\r\npills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without\r\nthe poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my\r\ngentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I\r\nate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good\r\ndeal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had\r\nalways my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I\r\nwas to use them.",
    "\"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\r\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within-so\r\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\r\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\r\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\r\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\r\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\r\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\r\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\r\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on\r\neach side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton\r\nRoad.",
    "\"There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\r\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\r\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, 'It's\r\ntime to get out,' I said.",
    "\"'All right, cabby,' said he.",
    "\"I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\r\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I\r\nhad to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\r\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\r\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\r\ndaughter were walking in front of us.",
    "\"'It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about.",
    "\"'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it to\r\na wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I\r\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who\r\nam I?'",
    "\"He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw\r\na horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\r\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\r\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\r\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and\r\nlaughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be\r\nsweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now\r\npossessed me.",
    "\"'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\r\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your\r\nwanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see\r\nto-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I\r\ncould see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time.\r\nThe pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I\r\nwould have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my\r\nnose and relieved me.",
    "\"'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door,\r\nand shaking the key in his face. 'Punishment has been slow in coming,\r\nbut it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I\r\nspoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was\r\nuseless.",
    "\"'Would you murder me?' he stammered.",
    "\"'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\r\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\r\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\r\nharem.'",
    "\"'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.",
    "\"'But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting\r\nthe box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.\r\nThere is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\r\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are\r\nruled by chance.'",
    "\"He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\r\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I\r\nswallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a\r\nminute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.\r\nShall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first\r\nwarning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as\r\nI saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was\r\nbut for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of\r\npain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\r\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\r\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\r\nwas no movement. He was dead!",
    "\"The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice\r\nof it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon\r\nthe wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the\r\npolice upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I\r\nremembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above\r\nhim, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret\r\nsocieties must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New\r\nYorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own\r\nblood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked\r\ndown to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the\r\nnight was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my\r\nhand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy's ring, and found\r\nthat it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only\r\nmemento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I\r\nstooped over Drebber's body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side\r\nstreet, I went boldly up to the house-for I was ready to dare anything\r\nrather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into\r\nthe arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to\r\ndisarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.",
    "\"That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\r\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt. I\r\nknew that he was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung about\r\nall day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something\r\nwhen Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was\r\nStangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off\r\nby staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which\r\nwas the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage\r\nof some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so\r\nmade my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\r\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he\r\nhad taken so long before. I described Drebber's death to him, and I\r\ngave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at\r\nthe chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and\r\nflew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would\r\nhave been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed\r\nhis guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.",
    "\"I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up. I\r\nwent on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\r\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\r\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\r\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at\r\n221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next\r\nthing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and\r\nas neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my\r\nstory, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that\r\nI am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\"",
    "So thrilling had the man's narrative been, and his manner was so\r\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\r\ndetectives, _blas\u00e9_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\r\nbe keenly interested in the man's story. When he finished we sat for\r\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of\r\nLestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\r\naccount.",
    "\"There is only one point on which I should like a little more\r\ninformation,\" Sherlock Holmes said at last. \"Who was your accomplice\r\nwho came for the ring which I advertised?\"",
    "The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \"I can tell my own secrets,\"\r\nhe said, \"but I don't get other people into trouble. I saw your\r\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\r\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think\r\nyou'll own he did it smartly.\"",
    "\"Not a doubt of that,\" said Holmes heartily.",
    "\"Now, gentlemen,\" the Inspector remarked gravely, \"the forms of the law\r\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\r\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I\r\nwill be responsible for him.\" He rang the bell as he spoke, and\r\nJefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and\r\nI made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.",
    ".\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.",
    "We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\r\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\r\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\r\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be\r\nmeted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\r\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\r\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in\r\nhis dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\r\ndone.",
    "\"Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\" Holmes remarked,\r\nas we chatted it over next evening. \"Where will their grand\r\nadvertisement be now?\"",
    "\"I don't see that they had very much to do with his capture,\" I\r\nanswered.",
    "\"What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\" returned my\r\ncompanion, bitterly. \"The question is, what can you make people believe\r\nthat you have done. Never mind,\" he continued, more brightly, after a\r\npause. \"I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\r\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\r\nwere several most instructive points about it.\"",
    "\"Simple!\" I ejaculated.",
    "\"Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\" said Sherlock\r\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. \"The proof of its intrinsic simplicity\r\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was\r\nable to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\"",
    "\"That is true,\" said I.",
    "\"I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\r\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\r\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\r\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\r\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\r\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\r\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\"",
    "\"I confess,\" said I, \"that I do not quite follow you.\"",
    "\"I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\r\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\r\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\r\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\r\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\r\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\r\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\r\nbackwards, or analytically.\"",
    "\"I understand,\" said I.",
    "\"Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\r\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\r\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I\r\napproached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely\r\nfree from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway,\r\nand there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks\r\nof a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during\r\nthe night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private\r\ncarriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler\r\nis considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham.",
    "\"This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\r\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\r\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\r\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\r\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is\r\nso important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\r\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has\r\nmade it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\r\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first\r\npassed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been\r\nbefore the others, because in places their marks had been entirely\r\nobliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my\r\nsecond link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were\r\ntwo in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the\r\nlength of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from\r\nthe small and elegant impression left by his boots.",
    "\"On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\r\nwell-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder,\r\nif murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man's person, but\r\nthe agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen\r\nhis fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or\r\nany sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon\r\ntheir features. Having sniffed the dead man's lips I detected a\r\nslightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had\r\npoison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon\r\nhim from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\r\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would\r\nmeet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The\r\nforcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in\r\ncriminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in\r\nMontpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.",
    "\"And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\r\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\r\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I\r\nwas inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\r\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\r\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\r\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\r\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\r\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\r\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\r\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\r\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\r\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\r\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\r\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber's former career. He\r\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.",
    "\"I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\r\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished\r\nme with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\r\nlength of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there\r\nwere no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had\r\nburst from the murderer's nose in his excitement. I could perceive that\r\nthe track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom\r\nthat any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way\r\nthrough emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was\r\nprobably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged\r\ncorrectly.",
    "\"Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\r\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\r\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\r\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\r\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\r\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\r\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\r\nsecure the murderer.",
    "\"I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\r\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\r\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on\r\nin a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\r\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\r\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\r\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\r\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to\r\ndog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to\r\nturn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\r\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\r\nMetropolis.",
    "\"If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased\r\nto be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would\r\nbe likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time\r\nat least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to\r\nsuppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change\r\nhis name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore\r\norganized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically\r\nto every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that\r\nI wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of\r\nit, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was\r\nan incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\r\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\r\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\r\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\r\nor flaw.\"",
    "\"It is wonderful!\" I cried. \"Your merits should be publicly recognized.\r\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won't, I will for\r\nyou.\"",
    "\"You may do what you like, Doctor,\" he answered. \"See here!\" he\r\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, \"look at this!\"",
    "It was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed\r\nwas devoted to the case in question.",
    "\"The public,\" it said, \"have lost a sensational treat through the\r\nsudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.\r\nEnoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case\r\nwill probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good\r\nauthority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic\r\nfeud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the\r\nvictims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and\r\nHope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the\r\ncase has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most\r\nstriking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will\r\nserve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle\r\ntheir feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an\r\nopen secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to\r\nthe well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.\r\nThe man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in\r\nthe detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to\r\nattain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial\r\nof some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting\r\nrecognition of their services.\"",
    "\"Didn't I tell you so when we started?\" cried Sherlock Holmes with a\r\nlaugh. \"That's the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\r\ntestimonial!\"",
    "\"Never mind,\" I answered, \"I have all the facts in my journal, and the\r\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself\r\ncontented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser-",

    ".\r\nOUR SOCIETY",
    "IN the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the\r\nholders of houses above a certain rent are women.  If a married couple\r\ncome to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is\r\neither fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford\r\nevening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his\r\nship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great\r\nneighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a\r\nrailroad.  In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are\r\nnot at Cranford.  What could they do if they were there?  The surgeon\r\nhas his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man\r\ncannot be a surgeon.  For keeping the trim gardens full of choice\r\nflowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys\r\nwho look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing\r\nout at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the\r\ngates are left open; for deciding all questions of literature and\r\npolitics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or\r\narguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody's\r\naffairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in admirable\r\norder; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender\r\ngood offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of\r\nCranford are quite sufficient.  \"A man,\" as one of them observed to me\r\nonce, \"is _so_ in the way in the house!\"  Although the ladies of\r\nCranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly\r\nindifferent to each other's opinions. Indeed, as each has her own\r\nindividuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly developed,\r\nnothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will\r\nreigns among them to a considerable degree.",
    "The Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out\r\nin a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to\r\nprevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat.  Their\r\ndress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, \"What does it\r\nsignify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?\"  And\r\nif they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, \"What does it\r\nsignify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?\"  The materials of\r\ntheir clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are\r\nnearly as scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will\r\nanswer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in\r\nwear in England, was seen in Cranford-and seen without a smile.",
    "[Picture: A magnificent family red silk umbrella]",
    "I can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a\r\ngentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to\r\npatter to church on rainy days.  Have you any red silk umbrellas in\r\nLondon?  We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in\r\nCranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it \"a stick in\r\npetticoats.\"  It might have been the very red silk one I have described,\r\nheld by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little\r\nlady-the survivor of all-could scarcely carry it.",
    "Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they\r\nwere announced to any young people who might be staying in the town,\r\nwith all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a\r\nyear on the Tinwald Mount.",
    "\"Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey\r\nto-night, my dear\" (fifteen miles in a gentleman's carriage); \"they will\r\ngive you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they\r\nwill call; so be at liberty after twelve-from twelve to three are our\r\ncalling hours.\"",
    "Then, after they had called-",
    "\"It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never\r\nto let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and\r\nreturning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter\r\nof an hour.\"",
    "\"But am I to look at my watch?  How am I to find out when a quarter of\r\nan hour has passed?\"",
    "\"You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself\r\nto forget it in conversation.\"",
    "As everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid\r\na call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about.  We kept\r\nourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our\r\ntime.",
    "I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had\r\nsome difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the\r\nSpartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face.  We none of us\r\nspoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and\r\nthough some might be poor, we were all aristocratic.  The Cranfordians\r\nhad that kindly _esprit de corps_ which made them overlook all\r\ndeficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their\r\npoverty.  When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her\r\nbaby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on\r\nthe sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from\r\nunderneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural\r\nthing in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies\r\nas if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants' hall,\r\nsecond table, with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little\r\ncharity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been\r\nstrong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted\r\nin private by her mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know\r\nwhat cakes were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that\r\nwe knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all\r\nthe morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.",
    "There were one or two consequences arising from this general but\r\nunacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which\r\nwere not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of\r\nsociety to their great improvement.  For instance, the inhabitants of\r\nCranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under\r\nthe guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o'clock at night; and the\r\nwhole town was abed and asleep by half-past ten.  Moreover, it was\r\nconsidered \"vulgar\" (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything\r\nexpensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening\r\nentertainments.  Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all\r\nthat the Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the\r\nlate Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such \"elegant economy.\"",
    "\"Elegant economy!\"  How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of\r\nCranford!  There, economy was always \"elegant,\" and money-spending\r\nalways \"vulgar and ostentatious\"; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us\r\nvery peaceful and satisfied.  I never shall forget the dismay felt when\r\na certain Captain Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about\r\nhis being poor-not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and\r\nwindows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud\r\nmilitary voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a\r\nparticular house.  The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning\r\nover the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman.  He was\r\na half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring\r\nrailroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little\r\ntown; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection\r\nwith the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being\r\npoor-why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.  Death was as true\r\nand as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in\r\nthe streets.  It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite.  We had\r\ntacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of\r\nvisiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything\r\nthat they wished.  If we walked to or from a party, it was because the\r\nnight was _so_ fine, or the air _so_ refreshing, not because\r\nsedan-chairs were expensive.  If we wore prints, instead of summer\r\nsilks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till\r\nwe blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people\r\nof very moderate means.  Of course, then, we did not know what to make\r\nof a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace.  Yet,\r\nsomehow, Captain Brown made himself respected in Cranford, and was\r\ncalled upon, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary.  I was\r\nsurprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I\r\npaid to Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town.  My own\r\nfriends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit\r\nthe Captain and his daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was\r\neven admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve.  True, it was to\r\ndiscover the cause of a smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted;\r\nbut still Captain Brown walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a\r\nvoice too large for the room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man\r\nabout the house.  He had been blind to all the small slights, and\r\nomissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been received.  He\r\nhad been friendly, though the Cranford ladies had been cool; he had\r\nanswered small sarcastic compliments in good faith; and with his manly\r\nfrankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who\r\nwas not ashamed to be poor. And, at last, his excellent masculine common\r\nsense, and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic\r\ndilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the\r\nCranford ladies.  He himself went on in his course, as unaware of his\r\npopularity as he had been of the reverse; and I am sure he was startled\r\none day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some\r\ncounsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober, serious\r\nearnest.",
    "It was on this subject: An old lady had an Alderney cow, which she\r\nlooked upon as a daughter.  You could not pay the short quarter of an\r\nhour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful\r\nintelligence of this animal.  The whole town knew and kindly regarded\r\nMiss Betsy Barker's Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and\r\nregret when, in an unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a\r\nlime-pit.  She moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but\r\nmeanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking\r\nnaked, cold, and miserable, in a bare skin.  Everybody pitied the\r\nanimal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll\r\nappearance.  Miss Betsy Barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay;\r\nand it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil.  This remedy,\r\nperhaps, was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she\r\nasked; but the proposal, if ever it was made, was knocked on the head by\r\nCaptain Brown's decided \"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel\r\ndrawers, ma'am, if you wish to keep her alive.  But my advice is, kill\r\nthe poor creature at once.\"",
    "Miss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she\r\nset to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney\r\nmeekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel.  I have watched\r\nher myself many a time.  Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in\r\nLondon?",
    "[Picture: Meekly going to her pasture]",
    "Captain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town,\r\nwhere he lived with his two daughters.  He must have been upwards of\r\nsixty at the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left\r\nit as a residence.  But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a\r\nstiff military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made\r\nhim appear much younger than he was.  His eldest daughter looked almost\r\nas old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his\r\napparent age.  Miss Brown must have been forty; she had a sickly,\r\npained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of\r\nyouth had long faded out of sight.  Even when young she must have been\r\nplain and hard-featured.  Miss Jessie Brown was ten years younger than\r\nher sister, and twenty shades prettier.  Her face was round and dimpled.\r\n Miss Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause\r\nof which I will tell you presently), \"that she thought it was time for\r\nMiss Jessie to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to\r\nlook like a child.\"  It was true there was something childlike in her\r\nface; and there will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live\r\nto a hundred. Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight\r\nat you; her nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy;\r\nshe wore her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this\r\nappearance.  I do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked\r\nher face, and so did everybody, and I do not think she could help her\r\ndimples.  She had something of her father's jauntiness of gait and\r\nmanner; and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the\r\nattire of the two sisters-that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per\r\nannum more expensive than Miss Brown's.  Two pounds was a large sum in\r\nCaptain Brown's annual disbursements.",
    "Such was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first\r\nsaw them all together in Cranford Church.  The Captain I had met\r\nbefore-on the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some\r\nsimple alteration in the flue.  In church, he held his double eye-glass\r\nto his eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect\r\nand sang out loud and joyfully.  He made the responses louder than the\r\nclerk-an old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt\r\naggrieved at the Captain's sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher\r\nin consequence.",
    "On coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant\r\nattention to his two daughters.  He nodded and smiled to his\r\nacquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss\r\nBrown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and\r\nhad waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken\r\nup her gown to walk through the wet roads.",
    "I wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at their\r\nparties.  We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no\r\ngentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the\r\ncard-parties.  We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the\r\nevenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we\r\nhad almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be \"vulgar\"; so\r\nthat when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going to have\r\na party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Browns were invited,\r\nI wondered much what would be the course of the evening.  Card-tables,\r\nwith green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was\r\nthe third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four.\r\nCandles, and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table.  The\r\nfire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last\r\ndirections; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a\r\ncandle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon as the\r\nfirst knock came.  Parties in Cranford were solemn festivities, making\r\nthe ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best\r\ndresses.  As soon as three had arrived, we sat down to \"Preference,\" I\r\nbeing the unlucky fourth.  The next four comers were put down\r\nimmediately to another table; and presently the tea-trays, which I had\r\nseen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were placed\r\neach on the middle of a card-table. The china was delicate egg-shell;\r\nthe old-fashioned silver glittered with polishing; but the eatables were\r\nof the slightest description.  While the trays were yet on the tables,\r\nCaptain and the Miss Browns came in; and I could see that, somehow or\r\nother, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies present.  Ruffled\r\nbrows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at his approach.  Miss Brown\r\nlooked ill, and depressed almost to gloom. Miss Jessie smiled as usual,\r\nand seemed nearly as popular as her father. He immediately and quietly\r\nassumed the man's place in the room; attended to every one's wants,\r\nlessened the pretty maid-servant's labour by waiting on empty cups and\r\nbread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all in so easy and dignified\r\na manner, and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to\r\nattend to the weak, that he was a true man throughout.  He played for\r\nthreepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds;\r\nand yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye on his\r\nsuffering daughter-for suffering I was sure she was, though to many eyes\r\nshe might only appear to be irritable.  Miss Jessie could not play\r\ncards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her coming, had\r\nbeen rather inclined to be cross.  She sang, too, to an old cracked\r\npiano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth.  Miss Jessie sang,\r\n\"Jock of Hazeldean\" a little out of tune; but we were none of us\r\nmusical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time, by way of appearing\r\nto be so.",
    "It was very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a\r\nlittle before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie Brown's\r\nunguarded admission (_\u00e0 propos_ of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle,\r\nher mother's brother, who was a shopkeeper in Edinburgh.  Miss Jenkyns\r\ntried to drown this confession by a terrible cough-for the Honourable\r\nMrs Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Jessie, and what\r\nwould she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a\r\nshop-keeper's niece!  But Miss Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all\r\nagreed the next morning) _would_ repeat the information, and assure Miss\r\nPole she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required,\r\n\"through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any\r\none in Edinbro'.\"  It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths,\r\nand the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music;\r\nso I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.",
    "When the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a\r\nquarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking\r\nover tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a bit of literature.",
    "\"Have you seen any numbers of 'The Pickwick Papers'?\" said he.  (They\r\nwere then publishing in parts.)  \"Capital thing!\"",
    "Now Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on\r\nthe strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good\r\nlibrary of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any\r\nconversation about books as a challenge to her.  So she answered and\r\nsaid, \"Yes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them.\"",
    "\"And what do you think of them?\" exclaimed Captain Brown.  \"Aren't they\r\nfamously good?\"",
    "So urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak.",
    "\"I must say, I don't think they are by any means equal to Dr Johnson.\r\nStill, perhaps, the author is young.  Let him persevere, and who knows\r\nwhat he may become if he will take the great Doctor for his model?\"\r\nThis was evidently too much for Captain Brown to take placidly; and I\r\nsaw the words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Jenkyns had finished\r\nher sentence.",
    "\"It is quite a different sort of thing, my dear madam,\" he began.",
    "\"I am quite aware of that,\" returned she.  \"And I make allowances,\r\nCaptain Brown.\"",
    "\"Just allow me to read you a scene out of this month's number,\" pleaded\r\nhe.  \"I had it only this morning, and I don't think the company can have\r\nread it yet.\"",
    "\"As you please,\" said she, settling herself with an air of resignation.\r\nHe read the account of the \"swarry\" which Sam Weller gave at Bath.  Some\r\nof us laughed heartily.  _I_ did not dare, because I was staying in the\r\nhouse.  Miss Jenkyns sat in patient gravity.  When it was ended, she\r\nturned to me, and said with mild dignity-",
    "\"Fetch me 'Rasselas,' my dear, out of the book-room.\"",
    "When I had brought it to her, she turned to Captain Brown-",
    "\"Now allow _me_ to read you a scene, and then the present company can\r\njudge between your favourite, Mr Boz, and Dr Johnson.\"",
    "She read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac, in a\r\nhigh-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she said, \"I\r\nimagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr Johnson as a writer of\r\nfiction.\"  The Captain screwed his lips up, and drummed on the table,\r\nbut he did not speak.  She thought she would give him a finishing blow\r\nor two.",
    "[Picture: Endeavouring to beguile her into conversation]",
    "\"I consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of literature, to publish\r\nin numbers.\"",
    "\"How was the _Rambler_ published, ma'am?\" asked Captain Brown in a low\r\nvoice, which I think Miss Jenkyns could not have heard.",
    "\"Dr Johnson's style is a model for young beginners.  My father\r\nrecommended it to me when I began to write letters-I have formed my own\r\nstyle upon it; I recommended it to your favourite.\"",
    "\"I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such\r\npompous writing,\" said Captain Brown.",
    "Miss Jenkyns felt this as a personal affront, in a way of which the\r\nCaptain had not dreamed.  Epistolary writing she and her friends\r\nconsidered as her _forte_.  Many a copy of many a letter have I seen\r\nwritten and corrected on the slate, before she \"seized the half-hour\r\njust previous to post-time to assure\" her friends of this or of that;\r\nand Dr Johnson was, as she said, her model in these compositions.  She\r\ndrew herself up with dignity, and only replied to Captain Brown's last\r\nremark by saying, with marked emphasis on every syllable, \"I prefer Dr\r\nJohnson to Mr Boz.\"",
    "It is said-I won't vouch for the fact-that Captain Brown was heard to\r\nsay, _sotto voce_, \"D-n Dr Johnson!\"  If he did, he was penitent\r\nafterwards, as he showed by going to stand near Miss Jenkyns' arm-chair,\r\nand endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing\r\nsubject.  But she was inexorable.  The next day she made the remark I\r\nhave mentioned about Miss Jessie's dimples.",
    ".\r\nTHE CAPTAIN",
    "IT was impossible to live a month at Cranford and not know the daily\r\nhabits of each resident; and long before my visit was ended I knew much\r\nconcerning the whole Brown trio.  There was nothing new to be discovered\r\nrespecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly about\r\nthat from the very first.  They made no mystery of the necessity for\r\ntheir being economical.  All that remained to be discovered was the\r\nCaptain's infinite kindness of heart, and the various modes in which,\r\nunconsciously to himself, he manifested it.  Some little anecdotes were\r\ntalked about for some time after they occurred.  As we did not read\r\nmuch, and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there\r\nwas a dearth of subjects for conversation.  We therefore discussed the\r\ncircumstance of the Captain taking a poor old woman's dinner out of her\r\nhands one very slippery Sunday.  He had met her returning from the\r\nbakehouse as he came from church, and noticed her precarious footing;\r\nand, with the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved\r\nher of her burden, and steered along the street by her side, carrying\r\nher baked mutton and potatoes safely home.  This was thought very\r\neccentric; and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of\r\ncalls, on the Monday morning, to explain and apologise to the Cranford\r\nsense of propriety: but he did no such thing: and then it was decided\r\nthat he was ashamed, and was keeping out of sight.  In a kindly pity for\r\nhim, we began to say, \"After all, the Sunday morning's occurrence showed\r\ngreat goodness of heart,\" and it was resolved that he should be\r\ncomforted on his next appearance amongst us; but, lo! he came down upon\r\nus, untouched by any sense of shame, speaking loud and bass as ever, his\r\nhead thrown back, his wig as jaunty and well-curled as usual, and we\r\nwere obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about Sunday.",
    "Miss Pole and Miss Jessie Brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the\r\nstrength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting stitches; so it\r\nhappened that when I went to visit Miss Pole I saw more of the Browns\r\nthan I had done while staying with Miss Jenkyns, who had never got over\r\nwhat she called Captain Brown's disparaging remarks upon Dr Johnson as a\r\nwriter of light and agreeable fiction.  I found that Miss Brown was\r\nseriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain\r\noccasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I had\r\ntaken for unmitigated crossness.  Cross, too, she was at times, when the\r\nnervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance.\r\nMiss Jessie bore with her at these times, even more patiently than she\r\ndid with the bitter self-upbraidings by which they were invariably\r\nsucceeded. Miss Brown used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and\r\nirritable temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister\r\nwere obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries which\r\nwere necessaries in her condition.  She would so fain have made\r\nsacrifices for them, and have lightened their cares, that the original\r\ngenerosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper.  All this\r\nwas borne by Miss Jessie and her father with more than placidity-with\r\nabsolute tenderness. I forgave Miss Jessie her singing out of tune, and\r\nher juvenility of dress, when I saw her at home.  I came to perceive\r\nthat Captain Brown's dark Brutus wig and padded coat (alas! too often\r\nthreadbare) were remnants of the military smartness of his youth, which\r\nhe now wore unconsciously.  He was a man of infinite resources, gained\r\nin his barrack experience.  As he confessed, no one could black his\r\nboots to please him except himself; but, indeed, he was not above saving\r\nthe little maid-servant's labours in every way-knowing, most likely,\r\nthat his daughter's illness made the place a hard one.",
    "He endeavoured to make peace with Miss Jenkyns soon after the memorable\r\ndispute I have named, by a present of a wooden fire-shovel (his own\r\nmaking), having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one\r\nannoyed her.  She received the present with cool gratitude, and thanked\r\nhim formally.  When he was gone, she bade me put it away in the\r\nlumber-room; feeling, probably, that no present from a man who preferred\r\nMr Boz to Dr Johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.",
    "Such was the state of things when I left Cranford and went to Drumble.\r\nI had, however, several correspondents, who kept me _au fait_ as to the\r\nproceedings of the dear little town.  There was Miss Pole, who was\r\nbecoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting,\r\nand the burden of whose letter was something like, \"But don't you forget\r\nthe white worsted at Flint's\" of the old song; for at the end of every\r\nsentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission\r\nwhich I was to execute for her.  Miss Matilda Jenkyns (who did not mind\r\nbeing called Miss Matty, when Miss Jenkyns was not by) wrote nice, kind,\r\nrambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of her own; but\r\nsuddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me not to name what she\r\nhad said, as Deborah thought differently, and _she_ knew, or else\r\nputting in a postscript to the effect that, since writing the above, she\r\nhad been talking over the subject with Deborah, and was quite convinced\r\nthat, etc.-(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she\r\nhad given in the letter).  Then came Miss Jenkyns-Deborah, as she liked\r\nMiss Matty to call her, her father having once said that the Hebrew name\r\nought to be so pronounced.  I secretly think she took the Hebrew\r\nprophetess for a model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the\r\nstern prophetess in some ways, making allowance, of course, for modern\r\ncustoms and difference in dress.  Miss Jenkyns wore a cravat, and a\r\nlittle bonnet like a jockey-cap, and altogether had the appearance of a\r\nstrong-minded woman; although she would have despised the modern idea of\r\nwomen being equal to men.  Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior.\r\nBut to return to her letters.  Everything in them was stately and grand\r\nlike herself. I have been looking them over (dear Miss Jenkyns, how I\r\nhonoured her!) and I will give an extract, more especially because it\r\nrelates to our friend Captain Brown:-",
    "\"The Honourable Mrs Jamieson has only just quitted me; and, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, she communicated to me the intelligence that she\r\nhad yesterday received a call from her revered husband's quondam friend,\r\nLord Mauleverer.  You will not easily conjecture what brought his\r\nlordship within the precincts of our little town.  It was to see Captain\r\nBrown, with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the 'plumed\r\nwars,' and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his\r\nlordship's head when some great peril was impending over it, off the\r\nmisnomered Cape of Good Hope.  You know our friend the Honourable Mrs\r\nJamieson's deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity, and you will\r\ntherefore not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable\r\nto disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question.  I was\r\nanxious, I confess, to ascertain in what manner Captain Brown, with his\r\nlimited establishment, could receive so distinguished a guest; and I\r\ndiscovered that his lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to\r\nrefreshing slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals\r\nduring the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence.\r\nMrs Johnson, our civil butcher's wife, informs me that Miss Jessie\r\npurchased a leg of lamb; but, besides this, I can hear of no preparation\r\nwhatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor.\r\nPerhaps they entertained him with 'the feast of reason and the flow of\r\nsoul'; and to us, who are acquainted with Captain Brown's sad want of\r\nrelish for 'the pure wells of English undefiled,' it may be matter for\r\ncongratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by\r\nholding converse with an elegant and refined member of the British\r\naristocracy. But from some mundane failings who is altogether free?\"",
    "Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to me by the same post.  Such a piece of\r\nnews as Lord Mauleverer's visit was not to be lost on the Cranford\r\nletter-writers: they made the most of it.  Miss Matty humbly apologised\r\nfor writing at the same time as her sister, who was so much more capable\r\nthan she to describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a\r\nlittle bad spelling, Miss Matty's account gave me the best idea of the\r\ncommotion occasioned by his lordship's visit, after it had occurred;\r\nfor, except the people at the Angel, the Browns, Mrs Jamieson, and a\r\nlittle lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against\r\nthe aristocratic legs, I could not hear of any one with whom his\r\nlordship had held conversation.",
    "My next visit to Cranford was in the summer.  There had been neither\r\nbirths, deaths, nor marriages since I was there last.  Everybody lived\r\nin the same house, and wore pretty nearly the same well-preserved,\r\nold-fashioned clothes.  The greatest event was, that Miss Jenkyns had\r\npurchased a new carpet for the drawing-room.  Oh, the busy work Miss\r\nMatty and I had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon\r\nright down on this carpet through the blindless window!  We spread\r\nnewspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work; and,\r\nlo! in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was blazing away on a\r\nfresh spot; and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of\r\nthe newspapers.  We were very busy, too, one whole morning, before Miss\r\nJenkyns gave her party, in following her directions, and in cutting out\r\nand stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to\r\nevery chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty\r\nor defile the purity of the carpet.  Do you make paper paths for every\r\nguest to walk upon in London?",
    "Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns were not very cordial to each other.  The\r\nliterary dispute, of which I had seen the beginning, was a \"raw,\" the\r\nslightest touch on which made them wince.  It was the only difference of\r\nopinion they had ever had; but that difference was enough.  Miss Jenkyns\r\ncould not refrain from talking at Captain Brown; and, though he did not\r\nreply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt and resented\r\nas very disparaging to Dr Johnson.  He was rather ostentatious in his\r\npreference of the writings of Mr Boz; would walk through the streets so\r\nabsorbed in them that he all but ran against Miss Jenkyns; and though\r\nhis apologies were earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact,\r\ndo more than startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he\r\nhad knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of\r\nliterature.  The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and more worn,\r\nand his clothes were very threadbare.  But he seemed as bright and\r\ncheerful as ever, unless he was asked about his daughter's health.",
    "\"She suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we do what we can\r\nto alleviate her pain;-God's will be done!\"  He took off his hat at\r\nthese last words.  I found, from Miss Matty, that everything had been\r\ndone, in fact.  A medical man, of high repute in that country\r\nneighbourhood, had been sent for, and every injunction he had given was\r\nattended to, regardless of expense.  Miss Matty was sure they denied\r\nthemselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable; but\r\nthey never spoke about it; and as for Miss Jessie!-\"I really think she's\r\nan angel,\" said poor Miss Matty, quite overcome.  \"To see her way of\r\nbearing with Miss Brown's crossness, and the bright face she puts on\r\nafter she's been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it,\r\nis quite beautiful.  Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the\r\nCaptain at breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the Queen's bed\r\nall night. My dear! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or\r\nher pink bows again if you saw her as I have done.\"  I could only feel\r\nvery penitent, and greet Miss Jessie with double respect when I met her\r\nnext.  She looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if\r\nshe was very weak, when she spoke of her sister.  But she brightened,\r\nand sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she\r\nsaid-",
    "\"But, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for kindness!  I don't suppose\r\nany one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all\r\ncomes in a little covered basin for my sister.  The poor people will\r\nleave their earliest vegetables at our door for her.  They speak short\r\nand gruff, as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to\r\nmy heart to see their thoughtfulness.\"  The tears now came back and\r\noverflowed; but after a minute or two she began to scold herself, and\r\nended by going away the same cheerful Miss Jessie as ever.",
    "\"But why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for the man who\r\nsaved his life?\" said I.",
    "\"Why, you see, unless Captain Brown has some reason for it, he never\r\nspeaks about being poor; and he walked along by his lordship looking as\r\nhappy and cheerful as a prince; and as they never called attention to\r\ntheir dinner by apologies, and as Miss Brown was better that day, and\r\nall seemed bright, I daresay his lordship never knew how much care there\r\nwas in the background.  He did send game in the winter pretty often, but\r\nnow he is gone abroad.\"",
    "I had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and\r\nsmall opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves that were gathered ere\r\nthey fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden; the\r\nlittle bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some\r\ntown-dweller, or to burn in the chamber of some invalid.  Things that\r\nmany would despise, and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to\r\nperform, were all attended to in Cranford.  Miss Jenkyns stuck an apple\r\nfull of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss Brown's room;\r\nand as she put in each clove she uttered a Johnsonian sentence.  Indeed,\r\nshe never could think of the Browns without talking Johnson; and, as\r\nthey were seldom absent from her thoughts just then, I heard many a\r\nrolling, three-piled sentence.",
    "Captain Brown called one day to thank Miss Jenkyns for many little\r\nkindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had rendered.  He\r\nhad suddenly become like an old man; his deep bass voice had a quavering\r\nin it, his eyes looked dim, and the lines on his face were deep.  He did\r\nnot-could not-speak cheerfully of his daughter's state, but he talked\r\nwith manly, pious resignation, and not much.  Twice over he said, \"What\r\nJessie has been to us, God only knows!\" and after the second time, he\r\ngot up hastily, shook hands all round without speaking, and left the\r\nroom.",
    "That afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all listening\r\nwith faces aghast to some tale or other.  Miss Jenkyns wondered what\r\ncould be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step\r\nof sending Jenny out to inquire.",
    "Jenny came back with a white face of terror.  \"Oh, ma'am!  Oh, Miss\r\nJenkyns, ma'am!  Captain Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads!\"\r\nand she burst into tears.  She, along with many others, had experienced\r\nthe poor Captain's kindness.",
    "\"How?-where-where?  Good God!  Jenny, don't waste time in crying, but\r\ntell us something.\"  Miss Matty rushed out into the street at once, and\r\ncollared the man who was telling the tale.",
    "[Picture: She brought the affrighted carter ... into the\r\ndrawing-room]",
    "\"Come in-come to my sister at once, Miss Jenkyns, the rector's daughter.\r\nOh, man, man! say it is not true,\" she cried, as she brought the\r\naffrighted carter, sleeking down his hair, into the drawing-room, where\r\nhe stood with his wet boots on the new carpet, and no one regarded it.",
    "\"Please, mum, it is true.  I seed it myself,\" and he shuddered at the\r\nrecollection.  \"The Captain was a-reading some new book as he was deep\r\nin, a-waiting for the down train; and there was a little lass as wanted\r\nto come to its mammy, and gave its sister the slip, and came toddling\r\nacross the line.  And he looked up sudden, at the sound of the train\r\ncoming, and seed the child, and he darted on the line and cotched it up,\r\nand his foot slipped, and the train came over him in no time.  O Lord,\r\nLord!  Mum, it's quite true, and they've come over to tell his\r\ndaughters. The child's safe, though, with only a bang on its shoulder as\r\nhe threw it to its mammy.  Poor Captain would be glad of that, mum,\r\nwouldn't he?  God bless him!\"  The great rough carter puckered up his\r\nmanly face, and turned away to hide his tears.  I turned to Miss\r\nJenkyns.  She looked very ill, as if she were going to faint, and signed\r\nto me to open the window.",
    "\"Matilda, bring me my bonnet.  I must go to those girls.  God pardon me,\r\nif ever I have spoken contemptuously to the Captain!\"",
    "Miss Jenkyns arrayed herself to go out, telling Miss Matilda to give the\r\nman a glass of wine.  While she was away, Miss Matty and I huddled over\r\nthe fire, talking in a low and awestruck voice.  I know we cried quietly\r\nall the time.",
    "Miss Jenkyns came home in a silent mood, and we durst not ask her many\r\nquestions.  She told us that Miss Jessie had fainted, and that she and\r\nMiss Pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round; but that, as\r\nsoon as she recovered, she begged one of them to go and sit with her\r\nsister.",
    "\"Mr Hoggins says she cannot live many days, and she shall be spared this\r\nshock,\" said Miss Jessie, shivering with feelings to which she dared not\r\ngive way.",
    "\"But how can you manage, my dear?\" asked Miss Jenkyns; \"you cannot bear\r\nup, she must see your tears.\"",
    "\"God will help me-I will not give way-she was asleep when the news came;\r\nshe may be asleep yet.  She would be so utterly miserable, not merely at\r\nmy father's death, but to think of what would become of me; she is so\r\ngood to me.\"  She looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true\r\neyes, and Miss Pole told Miss Jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear\r\nit, knowing, as she did, how Miss Brown treated her sister.",
    "However, it was settled according to Miss Jessie's wish.  Miss Brown was\r\nto be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on\r\nrailway business.  They had managed it in some way-Miss Jenkyns could\r\nnot exactly say how.  Miss Pole was to stop with Miss Jessie.  Mrs\r\nJamieson had sent to inquire.  And this was all we heard that night; and\r\na sorrowful night it was.  The next day a full account of the fatal\r\naccident was in the county paper which Miss Jenkyns took in.  Her eyes\r\nwere very weak, she said, and she asked me to read it.  When I came to\r\nthe \"gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of\r\n'Pickwick,' which he had just received,\" Miss Jenkyns shook her head\r\nlong and solemnly, and then sighed out, \"Poor, dear, infatuated man!\"",
    "The corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church, there\r\nto be interred.  Miss Jessie had set her heart on following it to the\r\ngrave; and no dissuasives could alter her resolve.  Her restraint upon\r\nherself made her almost obstinate; she resisted all Miss Pole's\r\nentreaties and Miss Jenkyns' advice.  At last Miss Jenkyns gave up the\r\npoint; and after a silence, which I feared portended some deep\r\ndispleasure against Miss Jessie, Miss Jenkyns said she should accompany\r\nthe latter to the funeral.",
    "\"It is not fit for you to go alone.  It would be against both propriety\r\nand humanity were I to allow it.\"",
    "Miss Jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement; but her\r\nobstinacy, if she had any, had been exhausted in her determination to go\r\nto the interment.  She longed, poor thing, I have no doubt, to cry alone\r\nover the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all, and\r\nto give way, for one little half-hour, uninterrupted by sympathy and\r\nunobserved by friendship.  But it was not to be.  That afternoon Miss\r\nJenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape, and employed herself busily\r\nin trimming the little black silk bonnet I have spoken about.  When it\r\nwas finished she put it on, and looked at us for approbation-admiration\r\nshe despised.  I was full of sorrow, but, by one of those whimsical\r\nthoughts which come unbidden into our heads, in times of deepest grief,\r\nI no sooner saw the bonnet than I was reminded of a helmet; and in that\r\nhybrid bonnet, half helmet, half jockey-cap, did Miss Jenkyns attend\r\nCaptain Brown's funeral, and, I believe, supported Miss Jessie with a\r\ntender, indulgent firmness which was invaluable, allowing her to weep\r\nher passionate fill before they left.",
    "Miss Pole, Miss Matty, and I, meanwhile attended to Miss Brown: and hard\r\nwork we found it to relieve her querulous and never-ending complaints.\r\nBut if we were so weary and dispirited, what must Miss Jessie have been!\r\nYet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength.  She\r\nput off her mourning dress, and came in, looking pale and gentle,\r\nthanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand.  She could even\r\nsmile-a faint, sweet, wintry smile-as if to reassure us of her power to\r\nendure; but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears, more than\r\nif she had cried outright.",
    "It was settled that Miss Pole was to remain with her all the watching\r\nlivelong night; and that Miss Matty and I were to return in the morning\r\nto relieve them, and give Miss Jessie the opportunity for a few hours of\r\nsleep.  But when the morning came, Miss Jenkyns appeared at the\r\nbreakfast-table, equipped in her helmet-bonnet, and ordered Miss Matty\r\nto stay at home, as she meant to go and help to nurse.  She was\r\nevidently in a state of great friendly excitement, which she showed by\r\neating her breakfast standing, and scolding the household all round.",
    "No nursing-no energetic strong-minded woman could help Miss Brown now.\r\nThere was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all,\r\nand made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness.  Miss Brown was\r\ndying.  We hardly knew her voice, it was so devoid of the complaining\r\ntone we had always associated with it.  Miss Jessie told me afterwards\r\nthat it, and her face too, were just what they had been formerly, when\r\nher mother's death left her the young anxious head of the family, of\r\nwhom only Miss Jessie survived.",
    "She was conscious of her sister's presence, though not, I think, of\r\nours. We stood a little behind the curtain: Miss Jessie knelt with her\r\nface near her sister's, in order to catch the last soft awful whispers.",
    "\"Oh, Jessie!  Jessie!  How selfish I have been!  God forgive me for\r\nletting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did!  I have so loved\r\nyou-and yet I have thought only of myself.  God forgive me!\"",
    "\"Hush, love! hush!\" said Miss Jessie, sobbing.",
    "\"And my father, my dear, dear father!  I will not complain now, if God\r\nwill give me strength to be patient.  But, oh, Jessie! tell my father\r\nhow I longed and yearned to see him at last, and to ask his forgiveness.\r\n He can never know now how I loved him-oh! if I might but tell him,\r\nbefore I die!  What a life of sorrow his has been, and I have done so\r\nlittle to cheer him!\"",
    "A light came into Miss Jessie's face.  \"Would it comfort you, dearest,\r\nto think that he does know?-would it comfort you, love, to know that his\r\ncares, his sorrows\"-Her voice quivered, but she steadied it into\r\ncalmness-\"Mary! he has gone before you to the place where the weary are\r\nat rest.  He knows now how you loved him.\"",
    "A strange look, which was not distress, came over Miss Brown's face.\r\nShe did not speak for some time, but then we saw her lips form the\r\nwords, rather than heard the sound-\"Father, mother, Harry, Archy;\"-then,\r\nas if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened\r\nmind-\"But you will be alone, Jessie!\"",
    "Miss Jessie had been feeling this all during the silence, I think; for\r\nthe tears rolled down her cheeks like rain, at these words, and she\r\ncould not answer at first.  Then she put her hands together tight, and\r\nlifted them up, and said-but not to us-\"Though He slay me, yet will I\r\ntrust in Him.\"",
    "In a few moments more Miss Brown lay calm and still-never to sorrow or\r\nmurmur more.",
    "After this second funeral, Miss Jenkyns insisted that Miss Jessie should\r\ncome to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house, which,\r\nin fact, we learned from Miss Jessie, must now be given up, as she had\r\nnot wherewithal to maintain it.  She had something above twenty pounds a\r\nyear, besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would\r\nsell; but she could not live upon that: and so we talked over her\r\nqualifications for earning money.",
    "\"I can sew neatly,\" said she, \"and I like nursing.  I think, too, I\r\ncould manage a house, if any one would try me as housekeeper; or I would\r\ngo into a shop as saleswoman, if they would have patience with me at\r\nfirst.\"",
    "Miss Jenkyns declared, in an angry voice, that she should do no such\r\nthing; and talked to herself about \"some people having no idea of their\r\nrank as a captain's daughter,\" nearly an hour afterwards, when she\r\nbrought Miss Jessie up a basin of delicately-made arrowroot, and stood\r\nover her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished: then she\r\ndisappeared.  Miss Jessie began to tell me some more of the plans which\r\nhad suggested themselves to her, and insensibly fell into talking of the\r\ndays that were past and gone, and interested me so much I neither knew\r\nnor heeded how time passed.  We were both startled when Miss Jenkyns\r\nreappeared, and caught us crying.  I was afraid lest she would be\r\ndispleased, as she often said that crying hindered digestion, and I knew\r\nshe wanted Miss Jessie to get strong; but, instead, she looked queer and\r\nexcited, and fidgeted round us without saying anything.  At last she\r\nspoke.",
    "\"I have been so much startled-no, I've not been at all startled-don't\r\nmind me, my dear Miss Jessie-I've been very much surprised-in fact, I've\r\nhad a caller, whom you knew once, my dear Miss Jessie\"-",
    "Miss Jessie went very white, then flushed scarlet, and looked eagerly at\r\nMiss Jenkyns.",
    "\"A gentleman, my dear, who wants to know if you would see him.\"",
    "\"Is it?-it is not\"-stammered out Miss Jessie-and got no farther.",
    "\"This is his card,\" said Miss Jenkyns, giving it to Miss Jessie; and\r\nwhile her head was bent over it, Miss Jenkyns went through a series of\r\nwinks and odd faces to me, and formed her lips into a long sentence, of\r\nwhich, of course, I could not understand a word.",
    "\"May he come up?\" asked Miss Jenkyns at last.",
    "\"Oh, yes! certainly!\" said Miss Jessie, as much as to say, this is your\r\nhouse, you may show any visitor where you like.  She took up some\r\nknitting of Miss Matty's and began to be very busy, though I could see\r\nhow she trembled all over.",
    "Miss Jenkyns rang the bell, and told the servant who answered it to show\r\nMajor Gordon upstairs; and, presently, in walked a tall, fine,\r\nfrank-looking man of forty or upwards.  He shook hands with Miss Jessie;\r\nbut he could not see her eyes, she kept them so fixed on the ground.\r\nMiss Jenkyns asked me if I would come and help her to tie up the\r\npreserves in the store-room; and though Miss Jessie plucked at my gown,\r\nand even looked up at me with begging eye, I durst not refuse to go\r\nwhere Miss Jenkyns asked.  Instead of tying up preserves in the\r\nstore-room, however, we went to talk in the dining-room; and there Miss\r\nJenkyns told me what Major Gordon had told her; how he had served in the\r\nsame regiment with Captain Brown, and had become acquainted with Miss\r\nJessie, then a sweet-looking, blooming girl of eighteen; how the\r\nacquaintance had grown into love on his part, though it had been some\r\nyears before he had spoken; how, on becoming possessed, through the will\r\nof an uncle, of a good estate in Scotland, he had offered and been\r\nrefused, though with so much agitation and evident distress that he was\r\nsure she was not indifferent to him; and how he had discovered that the\r\nobstacle was the fell disease which was, even then, too surely\r\nthreatening her sister. She had mentioned that the surgeons foretold\r\nintense suffering; and there was no one but herself to nurse her poor\r\nMary, or cheer and comfort her father during the time of illness.  They\r\nhad had long discussions; and on her refusal to pledge herself to him as\r\nhis wife when all should be over, he had grown angry, and broken off\r\nentirely, and gone abroad, believing that she was a cold-hearted person\r\nwhom he would do well to forget.  He had been travelling in the East,\r\nand was on his return home when, at Rome, he saw the account of Captain\r\nBrown's death in _Galignani_.",
    "Just then Miss Matty, who had been out all the morning, and had only\r\nlately returned to the house, burst in with a face of dismay and\r\noutraged propriety.",
    "\"Oh, goodness me!\" she said.  \"Deborah, there's a gentleman sitting in\r\nthe drawing-room with his arm round Miss Jessie's waist!\"  Miss Matty's\r\neyes looked large with terror.",
    "[Picture: \"With his arm around Miss Jessie's waist!\"]",
    "Miss Jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant.",
    "\"The most proper place in the world for his arm to be in.  Go away,\r\nMatilda, and mind your own business.\"  This from her sister, who had\r\nhitherto been a model of feminine decorum, was a blow for poor Miss\r\nMatty, and with a double shock she left the room.",
    "The last time I ever saw poor Miss Jenkyns was many years after this.\r\nMrs Gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at\r\nCranford.  Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, and Miss Pole had all been to visit\r\nher, and returned with wonderful accounts of her house, her husband, her\r\ndress, and her looks.  For, with happiness, something of her early bloom\r\nreturned; she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for.\r\nHer eyes were always lovely, and, as Mrs Gordon, her dimples were not\r\nout of place.  At the time to which I have referred, when I last saw\r\nMiss Jenkyns, that lady was old and feeble, and had lost something of\r\nher strong mind.  Little Flora Gordon was staying with the Misses\r\nJenkyns, and when I came in she was reading aloud to Miss Jenkyns, who\r\nlay feeble and changed on the sofa.  Flora put down the _Rambler_ when I\r\ncame in.",
    "\"Ah!\" said Miss Jenkyns, \"you find me changed, my dear.  I can't see as\r\nI used to do.  If Flora were not here to read to me, I hardly know how I\r\nshould get through the day.  Did you ever read the _Rambler_?  It's a\r\nwonderful book-wonderful! and the most improving reading for Flora\"\r\n(which I daresay it would have been, if she could have read half the\r\nwords without spelling, and could have understood the meaning of a\r\nthird), \"better than that strange old book, with the queer name, poor\r\nCaptain Brown was killed for reading-that book by Mr Boz, you know-'Old\r\nPoz'; when I was a girl-but that's a long time ago-I acted Lucy in 'Old\r\nPoz.'\"  She babbled on long enough for Flora to get a good long spell at\r\nthe \"Christmas Carol,\" which Miss Matty had left on the table.",
    ".\r\nA LOVE AFFAIR OF LONG AGO",
    "I THOUGHT that probably my connection with Cranford would cease after\r\nMiss Jenkyns's death; at least, that it would have to be kept up by\r\ncorrespondence, which bears much the same relation to personal\r\nintercourse that the books of dried plants I sometimes see (\"Hortus\r\nSiccus,\" I think they call the thing) do to the living and fresh flowers\r\nin the lanes and meadows.  I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, by\r\nreceiving a letter from Miss Pole (who had always come in for a\r\nsupplementary week after my annual visit to Miss Jenkyns) proposing that\r\nI should go and stay with her; and then, in a couple of days after my\r\nacceptance, came a note from Miss Matty, in which, in a rather\r\ncircuitous and very humble manner, she told me how much pleasure I\r\nshould confer if I could spend a week or two with her, either before or\r\nafter I had been at Miss Pole's; \"for,\" she said, \"since my dear\r\nsister's death I am well aware I have no attractions to offer; it is\r\nonly to the kindness of my friends that I can owe their company.\"",
    "Of course I promised to come to dear Miss Matty as soon as I had ended\r\nmy visit to Miss Pole; and the day after my arrival at Cranford I went\r\nto see her, much wondering what the house would be like without Miss\r\nJenkyns, and rather dreading the changed aspect of things.  Miss Matty\r\nbegan to cry as soon as she saw me.  She was evidently nervous from\r\nhaving anticipated my call.  I comforted her as well as I could; and I\r\nfound the best consolation I could give was the honest praise that came\r\nfrom my heart as I spoke of the deceased.  Miss Matty slowly shook her\r\nhead over each virtue as it was named and attributed to her sister; and\r\nat last she could not restrain the tears which had long been silently\r\nflowing, but hid her face behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud.",
    "\"Dear Miss Matty,\" said I, taking her hand-for indeed I did not know in\r\nwhat way to tell her how sorry I was for her, left deserted in the\r\nworld. She put down her handkerchief and said-",
    "\"My dear, I'd rather you did not call me Matty.  She did not like it;\r\nbut I did many a thing she did not like, I'm afraid-and now she's gone!\r\nIf you please, my love, will you call me Matilda?\"",
    "I promised faithfully, and began to practise the new name with Miss Pole\r\nthat very day; and, by degrees, Miss Matilda's feeling on the subject\r\nwas known through Cranford, and we all tried to drop the more familiar\r\nname, but with so little success that by-and-by we gave up the attempt.",
    "My visit to Miss Pole was very quiet.  Miss Jenkyns had so long taken\r\nthe lead in Cranford that now she was gone, they hardly knew how to give\r\na party.  The Honourable Mrs Jamieson, to whom Miss Jenkyns herself had\r\nalways yielded the post of honour, was fat and inert, and very much at\r\nthe mercy of her old servants.  If they chose that she should give a\r\nparty, they reminded her of the necessity for so doing: if not, she let\r\nit alone.  There was all the more time for me to hear old-world stories\r\nfrom Miss Pole, while she sat knitting, and I making my father's shirts.\r\nI always took a quantity of plain sewing to Cranford; for, as we did not\r\nread much, or walk much, I found it a capital time to get through my\r\nwork.  One of Miss Pole's stories related to a shadow of a love affair\r\nthat was dimly perceived or suspected long years before.",
    "Presently, the time arrived when I was to remove to Miss Matilda's\r\nhouse. I found her timid and anxious about the arrangements for my\r\ncomfort. Many a time, while I was unpacking, did she come backwards and\r\nforwards to stir the fire which burned all the worse for being so\r\nfrequently poked.",
    "\"Have you drawers enough, dear?\" asked she.  \"I don't know exactly how\r\nmy sister used to arrange them.  She had capital methods.  I am sure she\r\nwould have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this,\r\nand Fanny has been with me four months.\"",
    "This subject of servants was a standing grievance, and I could not\r\nwonder much at it; for if gentlemen were scarce, and almost unheard of\r\nin the \"genteel society\" of Cranford, they or their\r\ncounterparts-handsome young men-abounded in the lower classes.  The\r\npretty neat servant-maids had their choice of desirable \"followers\"; and\r\ntheir mistresses, without having the sort of mysterious dread of men and\r\nmatrimony that Miss Matilda had, might well feel a little anxious lest\r\nthe heads of their comely maids should be turned by the joiner, or the\r\nbutcher, or the gardener, who were obliged, by their callings, to come\r\nto the house, and who, as ill-luck would have it, were generally\r\nhandsome and unmarried. Fanny's lovers, if she had any-and Miss Matilda\r\nsuspected her of so many flirtations that, if she had not been very\r\npretty, I should have doubted her having one-were a constant anxiety to\r\nher mistress.  She was forbidden, by the articles of her engagement, to\r\nhave \"followers\"; and though she had answered, innocently enough,\r\ndoubling up the hem of her apron as she spoke, \"Please, ma'am, I never\r\nhad more than one at a time,\" Miss Matty prohibited that one.  But a\r\nvision of a man seemed to haunt the kitchen.  Fanny assured me that it\r\nwas all fancy, or else I should have said myself that I had seen a man's\r\ncoat-tails whisk into the scullery once, when I went on an errand into\r\nthe store-room at night; and another evening, when, our watches having\r\nstopped, I went to look at the clock, there was a very odd appearance,\r\nsingularly like a young man squeezed up between the clock and the back\r\nof the open kitchen door: and I thought Fanny snatched up the candle\r\nvery hastily, so as to throw the shadow on the clock face, while she\r\nvery positively told me the time half-an-hour too early, as we found out\r\nafterwards by the church clock. But I did not add to Miss Matty's\r\nanxieties by naming my suspicions, especially as Fanny said to me, the\r\nnext day, that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows about\r\nit, she really was almost afraid to stay; \"for you know, miss,\" she\r\nadded, \"I don't see a creature from six o'clock tea, till Missus rings\r\nthe bell for prayers at ten.\"",
    "However, it so fell out that Fanny had to leave and Miss Matilda begged\r\nme to stay and \"settle her\" with the new maid; to which I consented,\r\nafter I had heard from my father that he did not want me at home.  The\r\nnew servant was a rough, honest-looking, country girl, who had only\r\nlived in a farm place before; but I liked her looks when she came to be\r\nhired; and I promised Miss Matilda to put her in the ways of the house.\r\nThe said ways were religiously such as Miss Matilda thought her sister\r\nwould approve.  Many a domestic rule and regulation had been a subject\r\nof plaintive whispered murmur to me during Miss Jenkyns's life; but now\r\nthat she was gone, I do not think that even I, who was a favourite,\r\ndurst have suggested an alteration.  To give an instance: we constantly\r\nadhered to the forms which were observed, at meal-times, in \"my father,\r\nthe rector's house.\"  Accordingly, we had always wine and dessert; but\r\nthe decanters were only filled when there was a party, and what remained\r\nwas seldom touched, though we had two wine-glasses apiece every day\r\nafter dinner, until the next festive occasion arrived, when the state of\r\nthe remainder wine was examined into in a family council.  The dregs\r\nwere often given to the poor: but occasionally, when a good deal had\r\nbeen left at the last party (five months ago, it might be), it was added\r\nto some of a fresh bottle, brought up from the cellar.  I fancy poor\r\nCaptain Brown did not much like wine, for I noticed he never finished\r\nhis first glass, and most military men take several.  Then, as to our\r\ndessert, Miss Jenkyns used to gather currants and gooseberries for it\r\nherself, which I sometimes thought would have tasted better fresh from\r\nthe trees; but then, as Miss Jenkyns observed, there would have been\r\nnothing for dessert in summer-time.  As it was, we felt very genteel\r\nwith our two glasses apiece, and a dish of gooseberries at the top, of\r\ncurrants and biscuits at the sides, and two decanters at the bottom.\r\nWhen oranges came in, a curious proceeding was gone through.  Miss\r\nJenkyns did not like to cut the fruit; for, as she observed, the juice\r\nall ran out nobody knew where; sucking (only I think she used some more\r\nrecondite word) was in fact the only way of enjoying oranges; but then\r\nthere was the unpleasant association with a ceremony frequently gone\r\nthrough by little babies; and so, after dessert, in orange season, Miss\r\nJenkyns and Miss Matty used to rise up, possess themselves each of an\r\norange in silence, and withdraw to the privacy of their own rooms to\r\nindulge in sucking oranges.",
    "I had once or twice tried, on such occasions, to prevail on Miss Matty\r\nto stay, and had succeeded in her sister's lifetime.  I held up a\r\nscreen, and did not look, and, as she said, she tried not to make the\r\nnoise very offensive; but now that she was left alone, she seemed quite\r\nhorrified when I begged her to remain with me in the warm\r\ndining-parlour, and enjoy her orange as she liked best.  And so it was\r\nin everything.  Miss Jenkyns's rules were made more stringent than ever,\r\nbecause the framer of them was gone where there could be no appeal.  In\r\nall things else Miss Matilda was meek and undecided to a fault.  I have\r\nheard Fanny turn her round twenty times in a morning about dinner, just\r\nas the little hussy chose; and I sometimes fancied she worked on Miss\r\nMatilda's weakness in order to bewilder her, and to make her feel more\r\nin the power of her clever servant.  I determined that I would not leave\r\nher till I had seen what sort of a person Martha was; and, if I found\r\nher trustworthy, I would tell her not to trouble her mistress with every\r\nlittle decision.",
    "Martha was blunt and plain-spoken to a fault; otherwise she was a brisk,\r\nwell-meaning, but very ignorant girl.  She had not been with us a week\r\nbefore Miss Matilda and I were astounded one morning by the receipt of a\r\nletter from a cousin of hers, who had been twenty or thirty years in\r\nIndia, and who had lately, as we had seen by the \"Army List,\" returned\r\nto England, bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been\r\nintroduced to her English relations.  Major Jenkyns wrote to propose\r\nthat he and his wife should spend a night at Cranford, on his way to\r\nScotland-at the inn, if it did not suit Miss Matilda to receive them\r\ninto her house; in which case they should hope to be with her as much as\r\npossible during the day. Of course it _must_ suit her, as she said; for\r\nall Cranford knew that she had her sister's bedroom at liberty; but I am\r\nsure she wished the Major had stopped in India and forgotten his cousins\r\nout and out.",
    "\"Oh! how must I manage?\" asked she helplessly.  \"If Deborah had been\r\nalive she would have known what to do with a gentleman-visitor.  Must I\r\nput razors in his dressing-room?  Dear! dear! and I've got none.\r\nDeborah would have had them.  And slippers, and coat-brushes?\"  I\r\nsuggested that probably he would bring all these things with him.  \"And\r\nafter dinner, how am I to know when to get up and leave him to his wine?\r\n Deborah would have done it so well; she would have been quite in her\r\nelement.  Will he want coffee, do you think?\"  I undertook the\r\nmanagement of the coffee, and told her I would instruct Martha in the\r\nart of waiting-in which it must be owned she was terribly deficient-and\r\nthat I had no doubt Major and Mrs Jenkyns would understand the quiet\r\nmode in which a lady lived by herself in a country town.  But she was\r\nsadly fluttered.  I made her empty her decanters and bring up two fresh\r\nbottles of wine.  I wished I could have prevented her from being present\r\nat my instructions to Martha, for she frequently cut in with some fresh\r\ndirection, muddling the poor girl's mind as she stood open-mouthed,\r\nlistening to us both.",
    "\"Hand the vegetables round,\" said I (foolishly, I see now-for it was\r\naiming at more than we could accomplish with quietness and simplicity);\r\nand then, seeing her look bewildered, I added, \"take the vegetables\r\nround to people, and let them help themselves.\"",
    "\"And mind you go first to the ladies,\" put in Miss Matilda.  \"Always go\r\nto the ladies before gentlemen when you are waiting.\"",
    "\"I'll do it as you tell me, ma'am,\" said Martha; \"but I like lads best.\"",
    "We felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of Martha's, yet I\r\ndon't think she meant any harm; and, on the whole, she attended very\r\nwell to our directions, except that she \"nudged\" the Major when he did\r\nnot help himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes, while she was\r\nhanding them round.",
    "The major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough when they\r\ndid come; languid, as all East Indians are, I suppose.  We were rather\r\ndismayed at their bringing two servants with them, a Hindoo body-servant\r\nfor the Major, and a steady elderly maid for his wife; but they slept at\r\nthe inn, and took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending\r\ncarefully to their master's and mistress's comfort.  Martha, to be sure,\r\nhad never ended her staring at the East Indian's white turban and brown\r\ncomplexion, and I saw that Miss Matilda shrunk away from him a little as\r\nhe waited at dinner.  Indeed, she asked me, when they were gone, if he\r\ndid not remind me of Blue Beard?  On the whole, the visit was most\r\nsatisfactory, and is a subject of conversation even now with Miss\r\nMatilda; at the time it greatly excited Cranford, and even stirred up\r\nthe apathetic and Honourable Mrs Jamieson to some expression of\r\ninterest, when I went to call and thank her for the kind answers she had\r\nvouchsafed to Miss Matilda's inquiries as to the arrangement of a\r\ngentleman's dressing-room-answers which I must confess she had given in\r\nthe wearied manner of the Scandinavian prophetess-",
    "\"Leave me, leave me to repose.\"",
    "And _now_ I come to the love affair.",
    "It seems that Miss Pole had a cousin, once or twice removed, who had\r\noffered to Miss Matty long ago.  Now this cousin lived four or five\r\nmiles from Cranford on his own estate; but his property was not large\r\nenough to entitle him to rank higher than a yeoman; or rather, with\r\nsomething of the \"pride which apes humility,\" he had refused to push\r\nhimself on, as so many of his class had done, into the ranks of the\r\nsquires.  He would not allow himself to be called Thomas Holbrook,\r\n_Esq._; he even sent back letters with this address, telling the\r\npost-mistress at Cranford that his name was _Mr_ Thomas Holbrook,\r\nyeoman.  He rejected all domestic innovations; he would have the house\r\ndoor stand open in summer and shut in winter, without knocker or bell to\r\nsummon a servant.  The closed fist or the knob of a stick did this\r\noffice for him if he found the door locked.  He despised every\r\nrefinement which had not its root deep down in humanity.  If people were\r\nnot ill, he saw no necessity for moderating his voice.  He spoke the\r\ndialect of the country in perfection, and constantly used it in\r\nconversation; although Miss Pole (who gave me these particulars) added,\r\nthat he read aloud more beautifully and with more feeling than any one\r\nshe had ever heard, except the late rector.",
    "\"And how came Miss Matilda not to marry him?\" asked I.",
    "\"Oh, I don't know.  She was willing enough, I think; but you know Cousin\r\nThomas would not have been enough of a gentleman for the rector and Miss\r\nJenkyns.\"",
    "\"Well! but they were not to marry him,\" said I, impatiently.",
    "\"No; but they did not like Miss Matty to marry below her rank.  You know\r\nshe was the rector's daughter, and somehow they are related to Sir Peter\r\nArley: Miss Jenkyns thought a deal of that.\"",
    "\"Poor Miss Matty!\" said I.",
    "\"Nay, now, I don't know anything more than that he offered and was\r\nrefused.  Miss Matty might not like him-and Miss Jenkyns might never\r\nhave said a word-it is only a guess of mine.\"",
    "\"Has she never seen him since?\" I inquired.",
    "\"No, I think not.  You see Woodley, Cousin Thomas's house, lies half-way\r\nbetween Cranford and Misselton; and I know he made Misselton his\r\nmarket-town very soon after he had offered to Miss Matty; and I don't\r\nthink he has been into Cranford above once or twice since-once, when I\r\nwas walking with Miss Matty, in High Street, and suddenly she darted\r\nfrom me, and went up Shire Lane.  A few minutes after I was startled by\r\nmeeting Cousin Thomas.\"",
    "\"How old is he?\" I asked, after a pause of castle-building.",
    "\"He must be about seventy, I think, my dear,\" said Miss Pole, blowing up\r\nmy castle, as if by gun-powder, into small fragments.",
    "Very soon after-at least during my long visit to Miss Matilda-I had the\r\nopportunity of seeing Mr Holbrook; seeing, too, his first encounter with\r\nhis former love, after thirty or forty years' separation.  I was helping\r\nto decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which they\r\nhad just received at the shop would do to match a grey and black\r\nmousseline-delaine that wanted a new breadth, when a tall, thin, Don\r\nQuixote-looking old man came into the shop for some woollen gloves.  I\r\nhad never seen the person (who was rather striking) before, and I\r\nwatched him rather attentively while Miss Matty listened to the shopman.\r\n The stranger wore a blue coat with brass buttons, drab breeches, and\r\ngaiters, and drummed with his fingers on the counter until he was\r\nattended to. When he answered the shop-boy's question, \"What can I have\r\nthe pleasure of showing you to-day, sir?\" I saw Miss Matilda start, and\r\nthen suddenly sit down; and instantly I guessed who it was.  She had\r\nmade some inquiry which had to be carried round to the other shopman.",
    "\"Miss Jenkyns wants the black sarsenet two-and-twopence the yard\"; and\r\nMr Holbrook had caught the name, and was across the shop in two strides.",
    "\"Matty-Miss Matilda-Miss Jenkyns!  God bless my soul!  I should not have\r\nknown you.  How are you? how are you?\"  He kept shaking her hand in a\r\nway which proved the warmth of his friendship; but he repeated so often,\r\nas if to himself, \"I should not have known you!\" that any sentimental\r\nromance which I might be inclined to build was quite done away with by\r\nhis manner.",
    "However, he kept talking to us all the time we were in the shop; and\r\nthen waving the shopman with the unpurchased gloves on one side, with\r\n\"Another time, sir! another time!\" he walked home with us.  I am happy\r\nto say my client, Miss Matilda, also left the shop in an equally\r\nbewildered state, not having purchased either green or red silk.  Mr\r\nHolbrook was evidently full with honest loud-spoken joy at meeting his\r\nold love again; he touched on the changes that had taken place; he even\r\nspoke of Miss Jenkyns as \"Your poor sister!  Well, well! we have all our\r\nfaults\"; and bade us good-bye with many a hope that he should soon see\r\nMiss Matty again.  She went straight to her room, and never came back\r\ntill our early tea-time, when I thought she looked as if she had been\r\ncrying.",
    "[Picture: Mr Holbrook ... bade us good-bye]",
    ".\r\nA VISIT TO AN OLD BACHELOR",
    "A FEW days after, a note came from Mr Holbrook, asking us-impartially\r\nasking both of us-in a formal, old-fashioned style, to spend a day at\r\nhis house-a long June day-for it was June now.  He named that he had\r\nalso invited his cousin, Miss Pole; so that we might join in a fly,\r\nwhich could be put up at his house.",
    "I expected Miss Matty to jump at this invitation; but, no!  Miss Pole\r\nand I had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to go.  She thought\r\nit was improper; and was even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the\r\nidea of any impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her\r\nold lover.  Then came a more serious difficulty.  She did not think\r\nDeborah would have liked her to go.  This took us half a day's good hard\r\ntalking to get over; but, at the first sentence of relenting, I seized\r\nthe opportunity, and wrote and despatched an acceptance in her\r\nname-fixing day and hour, that all might be decided and done with.",
    "The next morning she asked me if I would go down to the shop with her;\r\nand there, after much hesitation, we chose out three caps to be sent\r\nhome and tried on, that the most becoming might be selected to take with\r\nus on Thursday.",
    "She was in a state of silent agitation all the way to Woodley.  She had\r\nevidently never been there before; and, although she little dreamt I\r\nknew anything of her early story, I could perceive she was in a tremor\r\nat the thought of seeing the place which might have been her home, and\r\nround which it is probable that many of her innocent girlish\r\nimaginations had clustered.  It was a long drive there, through paved\r\njolting lanes.  Miss Matilda sat bolt upright, and looked wistfully out\r\nof the windows as we drew near the end of our journey.  The aspect of\r\nthe country was quiet and pastoral.  Woodley stood among fields; and\r\nthere was an old-fashioned garden where roses and currant-bushes touched\r\neach other, and where the feathery asparagus formed a pretty background\r\nto the pinks and gilly-flowers; there was no drive up to the door.  We\r\ngot out at a little gate, and walked up a straight box-edged path.",
    "\"My cousin might make a drive, I think,\" said Miss Pole, who was afraid\r\nof ear-ache, and had only her cap on.",
    "\"I think it is very pretty,\" said Miss Matty, with a soft plaintiveness\r\nin her voice, and almost in a whisper, for just then Mr Holbrook\r\nappeared at the door, rubbing his hands in very effervescence of\r\nhospitality.  He looked more like my idea of Don Quixote than ever, and\r\nyet the likeness was only external.  His respectable housekeeper stood\r\nmodestly at the door to bid us welcome; and, while she led the elder\r\nladies upstairs to a bedroom, I begged to look about the garden.  My\r\nrequest evidently pleased the old gentleman, who took me all round the\r\nplace and showed me his six-and-twenty cows, named after the different\r\nletters of the alphabet. As we went along, he surprised me occasionally\r\nby repeating apt and beautiful quotations from the poets, ranging easily\r\nfrom Shakespeare and George Herbert to those of our own day.  He did\r\nthis as naturally as if he were thinking aloud, and their true and\r\nbeautiful words were the best expression he could find for what he was\r\nthinking or feeling.  To be sure he called Byron \"my Lord Byrron,\" and\r\npronounced the name of Goethe strictly in accordance with the English\r\nsound of the letters-\"As Goethe says, 'Ye ever-verdant palaces,'\" &c.\r\nAltogether, I never met with a man, before or since, who had spent so\r\nlong a life in a secluded and not impressive country, with\r\never-increasing delight in the daily and yearly change of season and\r\nbeauty.",
    "When he and I went in, we found that dinner was nearly ready in the\r\nkitchen-for so I suppose the room ought to be called, as there were oak\r\ndressers and cupboards all round, all over by the side of the fireplace,\r\nand only a small Turkey carpet in the middle of the flag-floor.  The\r\nroom might have been easily made into a handsome dark oak dining-parlour\r\nby removing the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen, which\r\nwere evidently never used, the real cooking-place being at some\r\ndistance.  The room in which we were expected to sit was a\r\nstiffly-furnished, ugly apartment; but that in which we did sit was what\r\nMr Holbrook called the counting-house, where he paid his labourers their\r\nweekly wages at a great desk near the door.  The rest of the pretty\r\nsitting-room-looking into the orchard, and all covered over with dancing\r\ntree-shadows-was filled with books.  They lay on the ground, they\r\ncovered the walls, they strewed the table.  He was evidently half\r\nashamed and half proud of his extravagance in this respect.  They were\r\nof all kinds-poetry and wild weird tales prevailing.  He evidently chose\r\nhis books in accordance with his own tastes, not because such and such\r\nwere classical or established favourites.",
    "\"Ah!\" he said, \"we farmers ought not to have much time for reading; yet\r\nsomehow one can't help it.\"",
    "\"What a pretty room!\" said Miss Matty, _sotto voce_.",
    "\"What a pleasant place!\" said I, aloud, almost simultaneously.",
    "\"Nay! if you like it,\" replied he; \"but can you sit on these great,\r\nblack leather, three-cornered chairs?  I like it better than the best\r\nparlour; but I thought ladies would take that for the smarter place.\"",
    "It was the smarter place, but, like most smart things, not at all\r\npretty, or pleasant, or home-like; so, while we were at dinner, the\r\nservant-girl dusted and scrubbed the counting-house chairs, and we sat\r\nthere all the rest of the day.",
    "We had pudding before meat; and I thought Mr Holbrook was going to make\r\nsome apology for his old-fashioned ways, for he began-",
    "\"I don't know whether you like newfangled ways.\"",
    "\"Oh, not at all!\" said Miss Matty.",
    "\"No more do I,\" said he.  \"My housekeeper _will_ have these in her new\r\nfashion; or else I tell her that, when I was a young man, we used to\r\nkeep strictly to my father's rule, 'No broth, no ball; no ball, no\r\nbeef'; and always began dinner with broth.  Then we had suet puddings,\r\nboiled in the broth with the beef: and then the meat itself.  If we did\r\nnot sup our broth, we had no ball, which we liked a deal better; and the\r\nbeef came last of all, and only those had it who had done justice to the\r\nbroth and the ball.  Now folks begin with sweet things, and turn their\r\ndinners topsy-turvy.\"",
    "When the ducks and green peas came, we looked at each other in dismay;\r\nwe had only two-pronged, black-handled forks.  It is true the steel was\r\nas bright as silver; but what were we to do?  Miss Matty picked up her\r\npeas, one by one, on the point of the prongs, much as Amin\u00e9 ate her\r\ngrains of rice after her previous feast with the Ghoul.  Miss Pole\r\nsighed over her delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her\r\nplate untasted, for they _would_ drop between the prongs.  I looked at\r\nmy host: the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,\r\nshovelled up by his large round-ended knife.  I saw, I imitated, I\r\nsurvived!  My friends, in spite of my precedent, could not muster up\r\ncourage enough to do an ungenteel thing; and, if Mr Holbrook had not\r\nbeen so heartily hungry, he would probably have seen that the good peas\r\nwent away almost untouched.",
    "After dinner, a clay pipe was brought in, and a spittoon; and, asking us\r\nto retire to another room, where he would soon join us, if we disliked\r\ntobacco-smoke, he presented his pipe to Miss Matty, and requested her to\r\nfill the bowl.  This was a compliment to a lady in his youth; but it was\r\nrather inappropriate to propose it as an honour to Miss Matty, who had\r\nbeen trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter\r\nabhorrence.  But if it was a shock to her refinement, it was also a\r\ngratification to her feelings to be thus selected; so she daintily\r\nstuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe, and then we withdrew.",
    "\"It is very pleasant dining with a bachelor,\" said Miss Matty softly, as\r\nwe settled ourselves in the counting-house.  \"I only hope it is not\r\nimproper; so many pleasant things are!\"",
    "\"What a number of books he has!\" said Miss Pole, looking round the room.\r\n\"And how dusty they are!\"",
    "\"I think it must be like one of the great Dr Johnson's rooms,\" said Miss\r\nMatty.  \"What a superior man your cousin must be!\"",
    "\"Yes!\" said Miss Pole, \"he's a great reader; but I am afraid he has got\r\ninto very uncouth habits with living alone.\"",
    "\"Oh! uncouth is too hard a word.  I should call him eccentric; very\r\nclever people always are!\" replied Miss Matty.",
    "[Picture: Now, what colour are ash-buds in March]",
    "When Mr Holbrook returned, he proposed a walk in the fields; but the two\r\nelder ladies were afraid of damp, and dirt, and had only very unbecoming\r\ncalashes to put on over their caps; so they declined, and I was again\r\nhis companion in a turn which he said he was obliged to take to see\r\nafter his men.  He strode along, either wholly forgetting my existence,\r\nor soothed into silence by his pipe-and yet it was not silence exactly.\r\nHe walked before me with a stooping gait, his hands clasped behind him;\r\nand, as some tree or cloud, or glimpse of distant upland pastures,\r\nstruck him, he quoted poetry to himself, saying it out loud in a grand\r\nsonorous voice, with just the emphasis that true feeling and\r\nappreciation give.  We came upon an old cedar tree, which stood at one\r\nend of the house-",
    "\"The cedar spreads his dark-green layers of shade.\"",
    "\"Capital term-'layers!'  Wonderful man!\"  I did not know whether he was\r\nspeaking to me or not; but I put in an assenting \"wonderful,\" although I\r\nknew nothing about it, just because I was tired of being forgotten, and\r\nof being consequently silent.",
    "He turned sharp round.  \"Ay! you may say 'wonderful.'  Why, when I saw\r\nthe review of his poems in _Blackwood_, I set off within an hour, and\r\nwalked seven miles to Misselton (for the horses were not in the way) and\r\nordered them.  Now, what colour are ash-buds in March?\"",
    "Is the man going mad? thought I.  He is very like Don Quixote.",
    "\"What colour are they, I say?\" repeated he vehemently.",
    "\"I am sure I don't know, sir,\" said I, with the meekness of ignorance.",
    "\"I knew you didn't.  No more did I-an old fool that I am!-till this\r\nyoung man comes and tells me.  Black as ash-buds in March.  And I've\r\nlived all my life in the country; more shame for me not to know.  Black:\r\nthey are jet-black, madam.\"  And he went off again, swinging along to\r\nthe music of some rhyme he had got hold of.",
    "When we came back, nothing would serve him but he must read us the poems\r\nhe had been speaking of; and Miss Pole encouraged him in his proposal, I\r\nthought, because she wished me to hear his beautiful reading, of which\r\nshe had boasted; but she afterwards said it was because she had got to a\r\ndifficult part of her crochet, and wanted to count her stitches without\r\nhaving to talk.  Whatever he had proposed would have been right to Miss\r\nMatty; although she did fall sound asleep within five minutes after he\r\nhad begun a long poem, called \"Locksley Hall,\" and had a comfortable\r\nnap, unobserved, till he ended; when the cessation of his voice wakened\r\nher up, and she said, feeling that something was expected, and that Miss\r\nPole was counting-",
    "\"What a pretty book!\"",
    "\"Pretty, madam! it's beautiful!  Pretty, indeed!\"",
    "\"Oh yes!  I meant beautiful!\" said she, fluttered at his disapproval of\r\nher word.  \"It is so like that beautiful poem of Dr Johnson's my sister\r\nused to read-I forget the name of it; what was it, my dear?\" turning to\r\nme.",
    "\"Which do you mean, ma'am?  What was it about?\"",
    "\"I don't remember what it was about, and I've quite forgotten what the\r\nname of it was; but it was written by Dr Johnson, and was very\r\nbeautiful, and very like what Mr Holbrook has just been reading.\"",
    "\"I don't remember it,\" said he reflectively.  \"But I don't know Dr\r\nJohnson's poems well.  I must read them.\"",
    "As we were getting into the fly to return, I heard Mr Holbrook say he\r\nshould call on the ladies soon, and inquire how they got home; and this\r\nevidently pleased and fluttered Miss Matty at the time he said it; but\r\nafter we had lost sight of the old house among the trees her sentiments\r\ntowards the master of it were gradually absorbed into a distressing\r\nwonder as to whether Martha had broken her word, and seized on the\r\nopportunity of her mistress's absence to have a \"follower.\"  Martha\r\nlooked good, and steady, and composed enough, as she came to help us\r\nout; she was always careful of Miss Matty, and to-night she made use of\r\nthis unlucky speech-",
    "\"Eh! dear ma'am, to think of your going out in an evening in such a thin\r\nshawl!  It's no better than muslin.  At your age, ma'am, you should be\r\ncareful.\"",
    "\"My age!\" said Miss Matty, almost speaking crossly, for her, for she was\r\nusually gentle-\"My age!  Why, how old do you think I am, that you talk\r\nabout my age?\"",
    "\"Well, ma'am, I should say you were not far short of sixty: but folks'\r\nlooks is often against them-and I'm sure I meant no harm.\"",
    "\"Martha, I'm not yet fifty-two!\" said Miss Matty, with grave emphasis;\r\nfor probably the remembrance of her youth had come very vividly before\r\nher this day, and she was annoyed at finding that golden time so far\r\naway in the past.",
    "But she never spoke of any former and more intimate acquaintance with Mr\r\nHolbrook.  She had probably met with so little sympathy in her early\r\nlove, that she had shut it up close in her heart; and it was only by a\r\nsort of watching, which I could hardly avoid since Miss Pole's\r\nconfidence, that I saw how faithful her poor heart had been in its\r\nsorrow and its silence.",
    "She gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every day, and sat\r\nnear the window, in spite of her rheumatism, in order to see, without\r\nbeing seen, down into the street.",
    "He came.  He put his open palms upon his knees, which were far apart, as\r\nhe sat with his head bent down, whistling, after we had replied to his\r\ninquiries about our safe return.  Suddenly he jumped up-",
    "\"Well, madam! have you any commands for Paris?  I am going there in a\r\nweek or two.\"",
    "\"To Paris!\" we both exclaimed.",
    "\"Yes, madam!  I've never been there, and always had a wish to go; and I\r\nthink if I don't go soon, I mayn't go at all; so as soon as the hay is\r\ngot in I shall go, before harvest time.\"",
    "We were so much astonished that we had no commissions.",
    "Just as he was going out of the room, he turned back, with his favourite\r\nexclamation-",
    "\"God bless my soul, madam! but I nearly forgot half my errand.  Here are\r\nthe poems for you you admired so much the other evening at my house.\"\r\nHe tugged away at a parcel in his coat-pocket.  \"Good-bye, miss,\" said\r\nhe; \"good-bye, Matty! take care of yourself.\"  And he was gone.  But he\r\nhad given her a book, and he had called her Matty, just as he used to do\r\nthirty years ago.",
    "\"I wish he would not go to Paris,\" said Miss Matilda anxiously.  \"I\r\ndon't believe frogs will agree with him; he used to have to be very\r\ncareful what he ate, which was curious in so strong-looking a young\r\nman.\"",
    "Soon after this I took my leave, giving many an injunction to Martha to\r\nlook after her mistress, and to let me know if she thought that Miss\r\nMatilda was not so well; in which case I would volunteer a visit to my\r\nold friend, without noticing Martha's intelligence to her.",
    "Accordingly I received a line or two from Martha every now and then;\r\nand, about November I had a note to say her mistress was \"very low and\r\nsadly off her food\"; and the account made me so uneasy that, although\r\nMartha did not decidedly summon me, I packed up my things and went.",
    "I received a warm welcome, in spite of the little flurry produced by my\r\nimpromptu visit, for I had only been able to give a day's notice.  Miss\r\nMatilda looked miserably ill; and I prepared to comfort and cosset her.",
    "I went down to have a private talk with Martha.",
    "\"How long has your mistress been so poorly?\" I asked, as I stood by the\r\nkitchen fire.",
    "\"Well!  I think it's better than a fortnight; it is, I know; it was one\r\nTuesday, after Miss Pole had been, that she went into this moping way.\r\nI thought she was tired, and it would go off with a night's rest; but\r\nno! she has gone on and on ever since, till I thought it my duty to\r\nwrite to you, ma'am.\"",
    "\"You did quite right, Martha.  It is a comfort to think she has so\r\nfaithful a servant about her.  And I hope you find your place\r\ncomfortable?\"",
    "\"Well, ma'am, missus is very kind, and there's plenty to eat and drink,\r\nand no more work but what I can do easily-but-\" Martha hesitated.",
    "\"But what, Martha?\"",
    "\"Why, it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any followers;\r\nthere's such lots of young fellows in the town; and many a one has as\r\nmuch as offered to keep company with me; and I may never be in such a\r\nlikely place again, and it's like wasting an opportunity.  Many a girl\r\nas I know would have 'em unbeknownst to missus; but I've given my word,\r\nand I'll stick to it; or else this is just the house for missus never to\r\nbe the wiser if they did come: and it's such a capable kitchen-there's\r\nsuch dark corners in it-I'd be bound to hide any one.  I counted up last\r\nSunday night-for I'll not deny I was crying because I had to shut the\r\ndoor in Jem Hearn's face, and he's a steady young man, fit for any girl;\r\nonly I had given missus my word.\"  Martha was all but crying again; and\r\nI had little comfort to give her, for I knew, from old experience, of\r\nthe horror with which both the Miss Jenkynses looked upon \"followers\";\r\nand in Miss Matty's present nervous state this dread was not likely to\r\nbe lessened.",
    "I went to see Miss Pole the next day, and took her completely by\r\nsurprise, for she had not been to see Miss Matilda for two days.",
    "\"And now I must go back with you, my dear, for I promised to let her\r\nknow how Thomas Holbrook went on; and, I'm sorry to say, his housekeeper\r\nhas sent me word to-day that he hasn't long to live.  Poor Thomas! that\r\njourney to Paris was quite too much for him.  His housekeeper says he\r\nhas hardly ever been round his fields since, but just sits with his\r\nhands on his knees in the counting-house, not reading or anything, but\r\nonly saying what a wonderful city Paris was!  Paris has much to answer\r\nfor if it's killed my cousin Thomas, for a better man never lived.\"",
    "\"Does Miss Matilda know of his illness?\" asked I-a new light as to the\r\ncause of her indisposition dawning upon me.",
    "\"Dear! to be sure, yes!  Has not she told you?  I let her know a\r\nfortnight ago, or more, when first I heard of it.  How odd she shouldn't\r\nhave told you!\"",
    "Not at all, I thought; but I did not say anything.  I felt almost guilty\r\nof having spied too curiously into that tender heart, and I was not\r\ngoing to speak of its secrets-hidden, Miss Matty believed, from all the\r\nworld. I ushered Miss Pole into Miss Matilda's little drawing-room, and\r\nthen left them alone.  But I was not surprised when Martha came to my\r\nbedroom door, to ask me to go down to dinner alone, for that missus had\r\none of her bad headaches.  She came into the drawing-room at tea-time,\r\nbut it was evidently an effort to her; and, as if to make up for some\r\nreproachful feeling against her late sister, Miss Jenkyns, which had\r\nbeen troubling her all the afternoon, and for which she now felt\r\npenitent, she kept telling me how good and how clever Deborah was in her\r\nyouth; how she used to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the\r\nparties (faint, ghostly ideas of grim parties, far away in the distance,\r\nwhen Miss Matty and Miss Pole were young!); and how Deborah and her\r\nmother had started the benefit society for the poor, and taught girls\r\ncooking and plain sewing; and how Deborah had once danced with a lord;\r\nand how she used to visit at Sir Peter Arley's, and tried to remodel the\r\nquiet rectory establishment on the plans of Arley Hall, where they kept\r\nthirty servants; and how she had nursed Miss Matty through a long, long\r\nillness, of which I had never heard before, but which I now dated in my\r\nown mind as following the dismissal of the suit of Mr Holbrook.  So we\r\ntalked softly and quietly of old times through the long November\r\nevening.",
    "The next day Miss Pole brought us word that Mr Holbrook was dead.  Miss\r\nMatty heard the news in silence; in fact, from the account of the\r\nprevious day, it was only what we had to expect.  Miss Pole kept calling\r\nupon us for some expression of regret, by asking if it was not sad that\r\nhe was gone, and saying-",
    "\"To think of that pleasant day last June, when he seemed so well!  And\r\nhe might have lived this dozen years if he had not gone to that wicked\r\nParis, where they are always having revolutions.\"",
    "She paused for some demonstration on our part.  I saw Miss Matty could\r\nnot speak, she was trembling so nervously; so I said what I really felt;\r\nand after a call of some duration-all the time of which I have no doubt\r\nMiss Pole thought Miss Matty received the news very calmly-our visitor\r\ntook her leave.",
    "Miss Matty made a strong effort to conceal her feelings-a concealment\r\nshe practised even with me, for she has never alluded to Mr Holbrook\r\nagain, although the book he gave her lies with her Bible on the little\r\ntable by her bedside.  She did not think I heard her when she asked the\r\nlittle milliner of Cranford to make her caps something like the\r\nHonourable Mrs Jamieson's, or that I noticed the reply-",
    "\"But she wears widows' caps, ma'am?\"",
    "\"Oh!  I only meant something in that style; not widows', of course, but\r\nrather like Mrs Jamieson's.\"",
    "This effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous motion of\r\nhead and hands which I have seen ever since in Miss Matty.",
    "The evening of the day on which we heard of Mr Holbrook's death, Miss\r\nMatilda was very silent and thoughtful; after prayers she called Martha\r\nback and then she stood uncertain what to say.",
    "\"Martha!\" she said, at last, \"you are young\"-and then she made so long a\r\npause that Martha, to remind her of her half-finished sentence, dropped\r\na curtsey, and said-",
    "\"Yes, please, ma'am; two-and-twenty last third of October, please,\r\nma'am.\"",
    "\"And, perhaps, Martha, you may some time meet with a young man you like,\r\nand who likes you.  I did say you were not to have followers; but if\r\nyou meet with such a young man, and tell me, and I find he is\r\nrespectable, I have no objection to his coming to see you once a week.\r\nGod forbid!\" said she in a low voice, \"that I should grieve any young\r\nhearts.\"  She spoke as if she were providing for some distant\r\ncontingency, and was rather startled when Martha made her ready eager\r\nanswer-",
    "\"Please, ma'am, there's Jem Hearn, and he's a joiner making\r\nthree-and-sixpence a-day, and six foot one in his stocking-feet, please,\r\nma'am; and if you'll ask about him to-morrow morning, every one will\r\ngive him a character for steadiness; and he'll be glad enough to come\r\nto-morrow night, I'll be bound.\"",
    "Though Miss Matty was startled, she submitted to Fate and Love.",
    ".\r\nOLD LETTERS",
    "I HAVE often noticed that almost every one has his own individual small\r\neconomies-careful habits of saving fractions of pennies in some one\r\npeculiar direction-any disturbance of which annoys him more than\r\nspending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance.  An old\r\ngentleman of my acquaintance, who took the intelligence of the failure\r\nof a Joint-Stock Bank, in which some of his money was invested, with\r\nstoical mildness, worried his family all through a long summer's day\r\nbecause one of them had torn (instead of cutting) out the written leaves\r\nof his now useless bank-book; of course, the corresponding pages at the\r\nother end came out as well, and this little unnecessary waste of paper\r\n(his private economy) chafed him more than all the loss of his money.\r\nEnvelopes fretted his soul terribly when they first came in; the only\r\nway in which he could reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished\r\narticle was by patiently turning inside out all that were sent to him,\r\nand so making them serve again.  Even now, though tamed by age, I see\r\nhim casting wistful glances at his daughters when they send a whole\r\ninside of a half-sheet of note paper, with the three lines of acceptance\r\nto an invitation, written on only one of the sides.  I am not above\r\nowning that I have this human weakness myself.  String is my foible.  My\r\npockets get full of little hanks of it, picked up and twisted together,\r\nready for uses that never come.  I am seriously annoyed if any one cuts\r\nthe string of a parcel instead of patiently and faithfully undoing it\r\nfold by fold.  How people can bring themselves to use india-rubber\r\nrings, which are a sort of deification of string, as lightly as they do,\r\nI cannot imagine.  To me an india-rubber ring is a precious treasure.  I\r\nhave one which is not new-one that I picked up off the floor nearly six\r\nyears ago.  I have really tried to use it, but my heart failed me, and I\r\ncould not commit the extravagance.",
    "Small pieces of butter grieve others.  They cannot attend to\r\nconversation because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some\r\npeople have of invariably taking more butter than they want.  Have you\r\nnot seen the anxious look (almost mesmeric) which such persons fix on\r\nthe article? They would feel it a relief if they might bury it out of\r\ntheir sight by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing it down;\r\nand they are really made happy if the person on whose plate it lies\r\nunused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast (which he does not want at\r\nall) and eats up his butter.  They think that this is not waste.",
    "Now Miss Matty Jenkyns was chary of candles.  We had many devices to use\r\nas few as possible.  In the winter afternoons she would sit knitting for\r\ntwo or three hours-she could do this in the dark, or by firelight-and\r\nwhen I asked if I might not ring for candles to finish stitching my\r\nwristbands, she told me to \"keep blind man's holiday.\"  They were\r\nusually brought in with tea; but we only burnt one at a time.  As we\r\nlived in constant preparation for a friend who might come in any evening\r\n(but who never did), it required some contrivance to keep our two\r\ncandles of the same length, ready to be lighted, and to look as if we\r\nburnt two always. The candles took it in turns; and, whatever we might\r\nbe talking about or doing, Miss Matty's eyes were habitually fixed upon\r\nthe candle, ready to jump up and extinguish it and to light the other\r\nbefore they had become too uneven in length to be restored to equality\r\nin the course of the evening.",
    "One night, I remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me.  I\r\nhad been very much tired of my compulsory \"blind man's holiday,\"\r\nespecially as Miss Matty had fallen asleep, and I did not like to stir\r\nthe fire and run the risk of awakening her; so I could not even sit on\r\nthe rug, and scorch myself with sewing by firelight, according to my\r\nusual custom.  I fancied Miss Matty must be dreaming of her early life;\r\nfor she spoke one or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing reference to\r\npersons who were dead long before.  When Martha brought in the lighted\r\ncandle and tea, Miss Matty started into wakefulness, with a strange,\r\nbewildered look around, as if we were not the people she expected to see\r\nabout her. There was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as\r\nshe recognised me; but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her\r\nusual smile.  All through tea-time her talk ran upon the days of her\r\nchildhood and youth.  Perhaps this reminded her of the desirableness of\r\nlooking over all the old family letters, and destroying such as ought\r\nnot to be allowed to fall into the hands of strangers; for she had often\r\nspoken of the necessity of this task, but had always shrunk from it,\r\nwith a timid dread of something painful.  To-night, however, she rose up\r\nafter tea and went for them-in the dark; for she piqued herself on the\r\nprecise neatness of all her chamber arrangements, and used to look\r\nuneasily at me when I lighted a bed-candle to go to another room for\r\nanything.  When she returned there was a faint, pleasant smell of\r\nTonquin beans in the room. I had always noticed this scent about any of\r\nthe things which had belonged to her mother; and many of the letters\r\nwere addressed to her-yellow bundles of love-letters, sixty or seventy\r\nyears old.",
    "Miss Matty undid the packet with a sigh; but she stifled it directly, as\r\nif it were hardly right to regret the flight of time, or of life either.\r\nWe agreed to look them over separately, each taking a different letter\r\nout of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before\r\ndestroying it.  I never knew what sad work the reading of old letters\r\nwas before that evening, though I could hardly tell why.  The letters\r\nwere as happy as letters could be-at least those early letters were.\r\nThere was in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time, which\r\nseemed so strong and full, as if it could never pass away, and as if the\r\nwarm, living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die, and be\r\nas nothing to the sunny earth.  I should have felt less melancholy, I\r\nbelieve, if the letters had been more so.  I saw the tears stealing down\r\nthe well-worn furrows of Miss Matty's cheeks, and her spectacles often\r\nwanted wiping.  I trusted at last that she would light the other candle,\r\nfor my own eyes were rather dim, and I wanted more light to see the\r\npale, faded ink; but no, even through her tears, she saw and remembered\r\nher little economical ways.",
    "The earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together, and ticketed\r\n(in Miss Jenkyns's handwriting) \"Letters interchanged between my\r\never-honoured father and my dearly-beloved mother, prior to their\r\nmarriage, in July 1774.\"  I should guess that the rector of Cranford was\r\nabout twenty-seven years of age when he wrote those letters; and Miss\r\nMatty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her\r\nwedding.  With my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the\r\ndining-parlour, stiff and stately, in a huge full-bottomed wig, with\r\ngown, cassock, and bands, and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he\r\never published-it was strange to read these letters.  They were full of\r\neager, passionate ardour; short homely sentences, right fresh from the\r\nheart (very different from the grand Latinised, Johnsonian style of the\r\nprinted sermon preached before some judge at assize time).  His letters\r\nwere a curious contrast to those of his girl-bride.  She was evidently\r\nrather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love, and\r\ncould not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing\r\nover in so many different ways; but what she was quite clear about was a\r\nlonging for a white \"Paduasoy\"-whatever that might be; and six or seven\r\nletters were principally occupied in asking her lover to use his\r\ninfluence with her parents (who evidently kept her in good order) to\r\nobtain this or that article of dress, more especially the white\r\n\"Paduasoy.\"  He cared nothing how she was dressed; she was always lovely\r\nenough for him, as he took pains to assure her, when she begged him to\r\nexpress in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of finery,\r\nin order that she might show what he said to her parents.  But at length\r\nhe seemed to find out that she would not be married till she had a\r\n\"trousseau\" to her mind; and then he sent her a letter, which had\r\nevidently accompanied a whole box full of finery, and in which he\r\nrequested that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired.\r\nThis was the first letter, ticketed in a frail, delicate hand, \"From my\r\ndearest John.\"  Shortly afterwards they were married, I suppose, from\r\nthe intermission in their correspondence.",
    "\"We must burn them, I think,\" said Miss Matty, looking doubtfully at me.\r\n\"No one will care for them when I am gone.\"  And one by one she dropped\r\nthem into the middle of the fire, watching each blaze up, die out, and\r\nrise away, in faint, white, ghostly semblance, up the chimney, before\r\nshe gave another to the same fate.  The room was light enough now; but\r\nI, like her, was fascinated into watching the destruction of those\r\nletters, into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured\r\nforth.",
    "The next letter, likewise docketed by Miss Jenkyns, was endorsed,\r\n\"Letter of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable\r\ngrandfather to my beloved mother, on occasion of my own birth.  Also\r\nsome practical remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the\r\nextremities of infants, from my excellent grandmother.\"",
    "The first part was, indeed, a severe and forcible picture of the\r\nresponsibilities of mothers, and a warning against the evils that were\r\nin the world, and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days\r\nold. His wife did not write, said the old gentleman, because he had\r\nforbidden it, she being indisposed with a sprained ankle, which (he\r\nsaid) quite incapacitated her from holding a pen.  However, at the foot\r\nof the page was a small \"T.O.,\" and on turning it over, sure enough,\r\nthere was a letter to \"my dear, dearest Molly,\" begging her, when she\r\nleft her room, whatever she did, to go _up_ stairs before going _down_:\r\nand telling her to wrap her baby's feet up in flannel, and keep it warm\r\nby the fire, although it was summer, for babies were so tender.",
    "It was pretty to see from the letters, which were evidently exchanged\r\nwith some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother, how\r\nthe girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her\r\nbaby. The white \"Paduasoy\" figured again in the letters, with almost as\r\nmuch vigour as before.  In one, it was being made into a christening\r\ncloak for the baby.  It decked it when it went with its parents to\r\nspend a day or two at Arley Hall.  It added to its charms, when it was\r\n\"the prettiest little baby that ever was seen.  Dear mother, I wish you\r\ncould see her! Without any pershality, I do think she will grow up a\r\nregular bewty!\"  I thought of Miss Jenkyns, grey, withered, and\r\nwrinkled, and I wondered if her mother had known her in the courts of\r\nheaven: and then I knew that she had, and that they stood there in\r\nangelic guise.",
    "There was a great gap before any of the rector's letters appeared.  And\r\nthen his wife had changed her mode of her endorsement.  It was no longer\r\nfrom, \"My dearest John;\" it was from \"My Honoured Husband.\"  The letters\r\nwere written on occasion of the publication of the same sermon which was\r\nrepresented in the picture.  The preaching before \"My Lord Judge,\" and\r\nthe \"publishing by request,\" was evidently the culminating point-the\r\nevent of his life.  It had been necessary for him to go up to London to\r\nsuperintend it through the press.  Many friends had to be called upon\r\nand consulted before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a\r\ntask; and at length it was arranged that J. and J. Rivingtons were to\r\nhave the honourable responsibility.  The worthy rector seemed to be\r\nstrung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch, for he could hardly\r\nwrite a letter to his wife without cropping out into Latin.  I remember\r\nthe end of one of his letters ran thus: \"I shall ever hold the virtuous\r\nqualities of my Molly in remembrance, _dum memor ipse mei_, _dum\r\nspiritus regit artus_,\" which, considering that the English of his\r\ncorrespondent was sometimes at fault in grammar, and often in spelling,\r\nmight be taken as a proof of how much he \"idealised his Molly;\" and, as\r\nMiss Jenkyns used to say, \"People talk a great deal about idealising\r\nnow-a-days, whatever that may mean.\"  But this was nothing to a fit of\r\nwriting classical poetry which soon seized him, in which his Molly\r\nfigured away as \"Maria.\"  The letter containing the _carmen_ was\r\nendorsed by her, \"Hebrew verses sent me by my honoured husband.  I thowt\r\nto have had a letter about killing the pig, but must wait.  Mem., to\r\nsend the poetry to Sir Peter Arley, as my husband desires.\"  And in a\r\npost-scriptum note in his handwriting it was stated that the Ode had\r\nappeared in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, December 1782.",
    "Her letters back to her husband (treasured as fondly by him as if they\r\nhad been _M. T. Ciceronis Epistol\u00e6_) were more satisfactory to an absent\r\nhusband and father than his could ever have been to her.  She told him\r\nhow Deborah sewed her seam very neatly every day, and read to her in the\r\nbooks he had set her; how she was a very \"forrard,\" good child, but\r\nwould ask questions her mother could not answer, but how she did not let\r\nherself down by saying she did not know, but took to stirring the fire,\r\nor sending the \"forrard\" child on an errand.  Matty was now the mother's\r\ndarling, and promised (like her sister at her age), to be a great\r\nbeauty. I was reading this aloud to Miss Matty, who smiled and sighed a\r\nlittle at the hope, so fondly expressed, that \"little Matty might not be\r\nvain, even if she were a bewty.\"",
    "\"I had very pretty hair, my dear,\" said Miss Matilda; \"and not a bad\r\nmouth.\"  And I saw her soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself\r\nup.",
    "But to return to Mrs Jenkyns's letters.  She told her husband about the\r\npoor in the parish; what homely domestic medicines she had administered;\r\nwhat kitchen physic she had sent.  She had evidently held his\r\ndispleasure as a rod in pickle over the heads of all the ne'er-do-wells.\r\n She asked for his directions about the cows and pigs; and did not\r\nalways obtain them, as I have shown before.",
    "The kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born, soon after\r\nthe publication of the sermon; but there was another letter of\r\nexhortation from the grandfather, more stringent and admonitory than\r\never, now that there was a boy to be guarded from the snares of the\r\nworld.  He described all the various sins into which men might fall,\r\nuntil I wondered how any man ever came to a natural death.  The gallows\r\nseemed as if it must have been the termination of the lives of most of\r\nthe grandfather's friends and acquaintance; and I was not surprised at\r\nthe way in which he spoke of this life being \"a vale of tears.\"",
    "It seemed curious that I should never have heard of this brother before;\r\nbut I concluded that he had died young, or else surely his name would\r\nhave been alluded to by his sisters.",
    "By-and-by we came to packets of Miss Jenkyns's letters.  These Miss\r\nMatty did regret to burn.  She said all the others had been only\r\ninteresting to those who loved the writers, and that it seemed as if it\r\nwould have hurt her to allow them to fall into the hands of strangers,\r\nwho had not known her dear mother, and how good she was, although she\r\ndid not always spell, quite in the modern fashion; but Deborah's letters\r\nwere so very superior! Any one might profit by reading them.  It was a\r\nlong time since she had read Mrs Chapone, but she knew she used to think\r\nthat Deborah could have said the same things quite as well; and as for\r\nMrs Carter! people thought a deal of her letters, just because she had\r\nwritten \"Epictetus,\" but she was quite sure Deborah would never have\r\nmade use of such a common expression as \"I canna be fashed!\"",
    "[Picture: I made use of the time to think of many other things]",
    "Miss Matty did grudge burning these letters, it was evident.  She would\r\nnot let them be carelessly passed over with any quiet reading, and\r\nskipping, to myself.  She took them from me, and even lighted the second\r\ncandle in order to read them aloud with a proper emphasis, and without\r\nstumbling over the big words.  Oh dear! how I wanted facts instead of\r\nreflections, before those letters were concluded!  They lasted us two\r\nnights; and I won't deny that I made use of the time to think of many\r\nother things, and yet I was always at my post at the end of each\r\nsentence.",
    "The rector's letters, and those of his wife and mother-in-law, had all\r\nbeen tolerably short and pithy, written in a straight hand, with the\r\nlines very close together.  Sometimes the whole letter was contained on\r\na mere scrap of paper.  The paper was very yellow, and the ink very\r\nbrown; some of the sheets were (as Miss Matty made me observe) the old\r\noriginal post, with the stamp in the corner representing a post-boy\r\nriding for life and twanging his horn.  The letters of Mrs Jenkyns and\r\nher mother were fastened with a great round red wafer; for it was before\r\nMiss Edgeworth's \"patronage\" had banished wafers from polite society.\r\nIt was evident, from the tenor of what was said, that franks were in\r\ngreat request, and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy\r\nmembers of Parliament.  The rector sealed his epistles with an immense\r\ncoat of arms, and showed by the care with which he had performed this\r\nceremony that he expected they should be cut open, not broken by any\r\nthoughtless or impatient hand.  Now, Miss Jenkyns's letters were of a\r\nlater date in form and writing.  She wrote on the square sheet which we\r\nhave learned to call old-fashioned.  Her hand was admirably calculated,\r\ntogether with her use of many-syllabled words, to fill up a sheet, and\r\nthen came the pride and delight of crossing.  Poor Miss Matty got sadly\r\npuzzled with this, for the words gathered size like snowballs, and\r\ntowards the end of her letter Miss Jenkyns used to become quite\r\nsesquipedalian.  In one to her father, slightly theological and\r\ncontroversial in its tone, she had spoken of Herod, Tetrarch of Idumea.\r\nMiss Matty read it \"Herod Petrarch of Etruria,\" and was just as well\r\npleased as if she had been right.",
    "I can't quite remember the date, but I think it was in 1805 that Miss\r\nJenkyns wrote the longest series of letters-on occasion of her absence\r\non a visit to some friends near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  These friends were\r\nintimate with the commandant of the garrison there, and heard from him\r\nof all the preparations that were being made to repel the invasion of\r\nBuonaparte, which some people imagined might take place at the mouth of\r\nthe Tyne.  Miss Jenkyns was evidently very much alarmed; and the first\r\npart of her letters was often written in pretty intelligible English,\r\nconveying particulars of the preparations which were made in the family\r\nwith whom she was residing against the dreaded event; the bundles of\r\nclothes that were packed up ready for a flight to Alston Moor (a wild\r\nhilly piece of ground between Northumberland and Cumberland); the signal\r\nthat was to be given for this flight, and for the simultaneous turning\r\nout of the volunteers under arms-which said signal was to consist (if I\r\nremember rightly) in ringing the church bells in a particular and\r\nominous manner.  One day, when Miss Jenkyns and her hosts were at a\r\ndinner-party in Newcastle, this warning summons was actually given (not\r\na very wise proceeding, if there be any truth in the moral attached to\r\nthe fable of the Boy and the Wolf; but so it was), and Miss Jenkyns,\r\nhardly recovered from her fright, wrote the next day to describe the\r\nsound, the breathless shock, the hurry and alarm; and then, taking\r\nbreath, she added, \"How trivial, my dear father, do all our\r\napprehensions of the last evening appear, at the present moment, to calm\r\nand enquiring minds!\"  And here Miss Matty broke in with-",
    "\"But, indeed, my dear, they were not at all trivial or trifling at the\r\ntime.  I know I used to wake up in the night many a time and think I\r\nheard the tramp of the French entering Cranford.  Many people talked of\r\nhiding themselves in the salt mines-and meat would have kept capitally\r\ndown there, only perhaps we should have been thirsty.  And my father\r\npreached a whole set of sermons on the occasion; one set in the\r\nmornings, all about David and Goliath, to spirit up the people to\r\nfighting with spades or bricks, if need were; and the other set in the\r\nafternoons, proving that Napoleon (that was another name for Bony, as we\r\nused to call him) was all the same as an Apollyon and Abaddon.  I\r\nremember my father rather thought he should be asked to print this last\r\nset; but the parish had, perhaps, had enough of them with hearing.\"",
    "Peter Marmaduke Arley Jenkyns (\"poor Peter!\" as Miss Matty began to call\r\nhim) was at school at Shrewsbury by this time.  The rector took up his\r\npen, and rubbed up his Latin once more, to correspond with his boy.  It\r\nwas very clear that the lad's were what are called show letters.  They\r\nwere of a highly mental description, giving an account of his studies,\r\nand his intellectual hopes of various kinds, with an occasional\r\nquotation from the classics; but, now and then, the animal nature broke\r\nout in such a little sentence as this, evidently written in a trembling\r\nhurry, after the letter had been inspected: \"Mother dear, do send me a\r\ncake, and put plenty of citron in.\"  The \"mother dear\" probably answered\r\nher boy in the form of cakes and \"goody,\" for there were none of her\r\nletters among this set; but a whole collection of the rector's, to whom\r\nthe Latin in his boy's letters was like a trumpet to the old war-horse.\r\nI do not know much about Latin, certainly, and it is, perhaps, an\r\nornamental language, but not very useful, I think-at least to judge from\r\nthe bits I remember out of the rector's letters.  One was, \"You have not\r\ngot that town in your map of Ireland; but _Bonus Bernardus non videt\r\nomnia_, as the Proverbia say.\"  Presently it became very evident that\r\n\"poor Peter\" got himself into many scrapes.  There were letters of\r\nstilted penitence to his father, for some wrong-doing; and among them\r\nall was a badly-written, badly-sealed, badly-directed, blotted note:-\"My\r\ndear, dear, dear, dearest mother, I will be a better boy; I will,\r\nindeed; but don't, please, be ill for me; I am not worth it; but I will\r\nbe good, darling mother.\"",
    "Miss Matty could not speak for crying, after she had read this note.\r\nShe gave it to me in silence, and then got up and took it to her sacred\r\nrecesses in her own room, for fear, by any chance, it might get burnt.\r\n\"Poor Peter!\" she said; \"he was always in scrapes; he was too easy.\r\nThey led him wrong, and then left him in the lurch.  But he was too fond\r\nof mischief.  He could never resist a joke.  Poor Peter!\"",
    ".\r\nPOOR PETER",
    "POOR Peter's career lay before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind\r\nfriends, but _Bonus Bernardus non videt omnia_, in this map too.  He was\r\nto win honours at the Shrewsbury School, and carry them thick to\r\nCambridge, and after that, a living awaited him, the gift of his\r\ngodfather, Sir Peter Arley.  Poor Peter! his lot in life was very\r\ndifferent to what his friends had hoped and planned.  Miss Matty told me\r\nall about it, and I think it was a relief when she had done so.",
    "He was the darling of his mother, who seemed to dote on all her\r\nchildren, though she was, perhaps, a little afraid of Deborah's superior\r\nacquirements.  Deborah was the favourite of her father, and when Peter\r\ndisappointed him, she became his pride.  The sole honour Peter brought\r\naway from Shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow\r\nthat ever was, and of being the captain of the school in the art of\r\npractical joking.  His father was disappointed, but set about remedying\r\nthe matter in a manly way.  He could not afford to send Peter to read\r\nwith any tutor, but he could read with him himself; and Miss Matty told\r\nme much of the awful preparations in the way of dictionaries and\r\nlexicons that were made in her father's study the morning Peter began.",
    "\"My poor mother!\" said she.  \"I remember how she used to stand in the\r\nhall, just near enough the study-door, to catch the tone of my father's\r\nvoice.  I could tell in a moment if all was going right, by her face.\r\nAnd it did go right for a long time.\"",
    "\"What went wrong at last?\" said I.  \"That tiresome Latin, I dare say.\"",
    "\"No! it was not the Latin.  Peter was in high favour with my father, for\r\nhe worked up well for him.  But he seemed to think that the Cranford\r\npeople might be joked about, and made fun of, and they did not like it;\r\nnobody does.  He was always hoaxing them; 'hoaxing' is not a pretty\r\nword, my dear, and I hope you won't tell your father I used it, for I\r\nshould not like him to think that I was not choice in my language, after\r\nliving with such a woman as Deborah.  And be sure you never use it\r\nyourself.  I don't know how it slipped out of my mouth, except it was\r\nthat I was thinking of poor Peter and it was always his expression.  But\r\nhe was a very gentlemanly boy in many things.  He was like dear Captain\r\nBrown in always being ready to help any old person or a child.  Still,\r\nhe did like joking and making fun; and he seemed to think the old ladies\r\nin Cranford would believe anything.  There were many old ladies living\r\nhere then; we are principally ladies now, I know, but we are not so old\r\nas the ladies used to be when I was a girl.  I could laugh to think of\r\nsome of Peter's jokes.  No, my dear, I won't tell you of them, because\r\nthey might not shock you as they ought to do, and they were very\r\nshocking.  He even took in my father once, by dressing himself up as a\r\nlady that was passing through the town and wished to see the Rector of\r\nCranford, 'who had published that admirable Assize Sermon.'  Peter said\r\nhe was awfully frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all\r\nin, and even offered to copy out all his Napoleon Buonaparte sermons for\r\nher-him, I mean-no, her, for Peter was a lady then.  He told me he was\r\nmore terrified than he ever was before, all the time my father was\r\nspeaking. He did not think my father would have believed him; and yet if\r\nhe had not, it would have been a sad thing for Peter.  As it was, he was\r\nnone so glad of it, for my father kept him hard at work copying out all\r\nthose twelve Buonaparte sermons for the lady-that was for Peter himself,\r\nyou know.  He was the lady.  And once when he wanted to go fishing,\r\nPeter said, 'Confound the woman!'-very bad language, my dear, but Peter\r\nwas not always so guarded as he should have been; my father was so angry\r\nwith him, it nearly frightened me out of my wits: and yet I could hardly\r\nkeep from laughing at the little curtseys Peter kept making, quite\r\nslyly, whenever my father spoke of the lady's excellent taste and sound\r\ndiscrimination.\"",
    "[Picture: Confound the woman]",
    "\"Did Miss Jenkyns know of these tricks?\" said I.",
    "\"Oh, no!  Deborah would have been too much shocked.  No, no one knew but\r\nme.  I wish I had always known of Peter's plans; but sometimes he did\r\nnot tell me.  He used to say the old ladies in the town wanted something\r\nto talk about; but I don't think they did.  They had the _St James's\r\nChronicle_ three times a week, just as we have now, and we have plenty\r\nto say; and I remember the clacking noise there always was when some of\r\nthe ladies got together.  But, probably, schoolboys talk more than\r\nladies. At last there was a terrible, sad thing happened.\"  Miss Matty\r\ngot up, went to the door, and opened it; no one was there.  She rang the\r\nbell for Martha, and when Martha came, her mistress told her to go for\r\neggs to a farm at the other end of the town.",
    "\"I will lock the door after you, Martha.  You are not afraid to go, are\r\nyou?\"",
    "\"No, ma'am, not at all; Jem Hearn will be only too proud to go with me.\"",
    "Miss Matty drew herself up, and as soon as we were alone, she wished\r\nthat Martha had more maidenly reserve.",
    "\"We'll put out the candle, my dear.  We can talk just as well by\r\nfirelight, you know.  There!  Well, you see, Deborah had gone from home\r\nfor a fortnight or so; it was a very still, quiet day, I remember,\r\noverhead; and the lilacs were all in flower, so I suppose it was spring.\r\nMy father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish; I\r\nrecollect seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovel-hat and\r\ncane.  What possessed our poor Peter I don't know; he had the sweetest\r\ntemper, and yet he always seemed to like to plague Deborah.  She never\r\nlaughed at his jokes, and thought him ungenteel, and not careful enough\r\nabout improving his mind; and that vexed him.",
    "\"Well! he went to her room, it seems, and dressed himself in her old\r\ngown, and shawl, and bonnet; just the things she used to wear in\r\nCranford, and was known by everywhere; and he made the pillow into a\r\nlittle-you are sure you locked the door, my dear, for I should not like\r\nanyone to hear-into-into a little baby, with white long clothes.  It was\r\nonly, as he told me afterwards, to make something to talk about in the\r\ntown; he never thought of it as affecting Deborah.  And he went and\r\nwalked up and down in the Filbert walk-just half-hidden by the rails,\r\nand half-seen; and he cuddled his pillow, just like a baby, and talked\r\nto it all the nonsense people do.  Oh dear! and my father came stepping\r\nstately up the street, as he always did; and what should he see but a\r\nlittle black crowd of people-I daresay as many as twenty-all peeping\r\nthrough his garden rails.  So he thought, at first, they were only\r\nlooking at a new rhododendron that was in full bloom, and that he was\r\nvery proud of; and he walked slower, that they might have more time to\r\nadmire.  And he wondered if he could make out a sermon from the\r\noccasion, and thought, perhaps, there was some relation between the\r\nrhododendrons and the lilies of the field.  My poor father!  When he\r\ncame nearer, he began to wonder that they did not see him; but their\r\nheads were all so close together, peeping and peeping!  My father was\r\namongst them, meaning, he said, to ask them to walk into the garden with\r\nhim, and admire the beautiful vegetable production, when-oh, my dear, I\r\ntremble to think of it-he looked through the rails himself, and saw-I\r\ndon't know what he thought he saw, but old Clare told me his face went\r\nquite grey-white with anger, and his eyes blazed out under his frowning\r\nblack brows; and he spoke out-oh, so terribly!-and bade them all stop\r\nwhere they were-not one of them to go, not one of them to stir a step;\r\nand, swift as light, he was in at the garden door, and down the Filbert\r\nwalk, and seized hold of poor Peter, and tore his clothes off his\r\nback-bonnet, shawl, gown, and all-and threw the pillow among the people\r\nover the railings: and then he was very, very angry indeed, and before\r\nall the people he lifted up his cane and flogged Peter!",
    "\"My dear, that boy's trick, on that sunny day, when all seemed going\r\nstraight and well, broke my mother's heart, and changed my father for\r\nlife.  It did, indeed.  Old Clare said, Peter looked as white as my\r\nfather; and stood as still as a statue to be flogged; and my father\r\nstruck hard!  When my father stopped to take breath, Peter said, 'Have\r\nyou done enough, sir?' quite hoarsely, and still standing quite quiet.\r\nI don't know what my father said-or if he said anything.  But old Clare\r\nsaid, Peter turned to where the people outside the railing were, and\r\nmade them a low bow, as grand and as grave as any gentleman; and then\r\nwalked slowly into the house.  I was in the store-room helping my mother\r\nto make cowslip wine.  I cannot abide the wine now, nor the scent of the\r\nflowers; they turn me sick and faint, as they did that day, when Peter\r\ncame in, looking as haughty as any man-indeed, looking like a man, not\r\nlike a boy. 'Mother!' he said, 'I am come to say, God bless you for\r\never.'  I saw his lips quiver as he spoke; and I think he durst not say\r\nanything more loving, for the purpose that was in his heart.  She\r\nlooked at him rather frightened, and wondering, and asked him what was\r\nto do.  He did not smile or speak, but put his arms round her and kissed\r\nher as if he did not know how to leave off; and before she could speak\r\nagain, he was gone. We talked it over, and could not understand it, and\r\nshe bade me go and seek my father, and ask what it was all about.  I\r\nfound him walking up and down, looking very highly displeased.",
    "\"'Tell your mother I have flogged Peter, and that he richly deserved\r\nit.'",
    "\"I durst not ask any more questions.  When I told my mother, she sat\r\ndown, quite faint, for a minute.  I remember, a few days after, I saw\r\nthe poor, withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap, to decay\r\nand die there.  There was no making of cowslip wine that year at the\r\nrectory-nor, indeed, ever after.",
    "\"Presently my mother went to my father.  I know I thought of Queen\r\nEsther and King Ahasuerus; for my mother was very pretty and\r\ndelicate-looking, and my father looked as terrible as King Ahasuerus.\r\nSome time after they came out together; and then my mother told me what\r\nhad happened, and that she was going up to Peter's room at my father's\r\ndesire-though she was not to tell Peter this-to talk the matter over\r\nwith him.  But no Peter was there.  We looked over the house; no Peter\r\nwas there!  Even my father, who had not liked to join in the search at\r\nfirst, helped us before long. The rectory was a very old house-steps up\r\ninto a room, steps down into a room, all through.  At first, my mother\r\nwent calling low and soft, as if to reassure the poor boy, 'Peter!\r\nPeter, dear! it's only me;' but, by-and-by, as the servants came back\r\nfrom the errands my father had sent them, in different directions, to\r\nfind where Peter was-as we found he was not in the garden, nor the\r\nhayloft, nor anywhere about-my mother's cry grew louder and wilder,\r\n'Peter!  Peter, my darling! where are you?' for then she felt and\r\nunderstood that that long kiss meant some sad kind of 'good-bye.'  The\r\nafternoon went on-my mother never resting, but seeking again and again\r\nin every possible place that had been looked into twenty times before,\r\nnay, that she had looked into over and over again herself. My father sat\r\nwith his head in his hands, not speaking except when his messengers came\r\nin, bringing no tidings; then he lifted up his face, so strong and sad,\r\nand told them to go again in some new direction.  My mother kept passing\r\nfrom room to room, in and out of the house, moving noiselessly, but\r\nnever ceasing.  Neither she nor my father durst leave the house, which\r\nwas the meeting-place for all the messengers.  At last (and it was\r\nnearly dark), my father rose up.  He took hold of my mother's arm as she\r\ncame with wild, sad pace through one door, and quickly towards another.\r\nShe started at the touch of his hand, for she had forgotten all in the\r\nworld but Peter.",
    "\"'Molly!' said he, 'I did not think all this would happen.'  He looked\r\ninto her face for comfort-her poor face all wild and white; for neither\r\nshe nor my father had dared to acknowledge-much less act upon-the terror\r\nthat was in their hearts, lest Peter should have made away with himself.\r\nMy father saw no conscious look in his wife's hot, dreary eyes, and he\r\nmissed the sympathy that she had always been ready to give him-strong\r\nman as he was, and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to\r\nflow. But when she saw this, a gentle sorrow came over her countenance,\r\nand she said, 'Dearest John! don't cry; come with me, and we'll find\r\nhim,' almost as cheerfully as if she knew where he was.  And she took my\r\nfather's great hand in her little soft one, and led him along, the tears\r\ndropping as he walked on that same unceasing, weary walk, from room to\r\nroom, through house and garden.",
    "\"Oh, how I wished for Deborah!  I had no time for crying, for now all\r\nseemed to depend on me.  I wrote for Deborah to come home.  I sent a\r\nmessage privately to that same Mr Holbrook's house-poor Mr Holbrook;-you\r\nknow who I mean.  I don't mean I sent a message to him, but I sent one\r\nthat I could trust to know if Peter was at his house.  For at one time\r\nMr Holbrook was an occasional visitor at the rectory-you know he was\r\nMiss Pole's cousin-and he had been very kind to Peter, and taught him\r\nhow to fish-he was very kind to everybody, and I thought Peter might\r\nhave gone off there.  But Mr Holbrook was from home, and Peter had never\r\nbeen seen. It was night now; but the doors were all wide open, and my\r\nfather and mother walked on and on; it was more than an hour since he\r\nhad joined her, and I don't believe they had ever spoken all that time.\r\nI was getting the parlour fire lighted, and one of the servants was\r\npreparing tea, for I wanted them to have something to eat and drink and\r\nwarm them, when old Clare asked to speak to me.",
    "\"'I have borrowed the nets from the weir, Miss Matty.  Shall we drag the\r\nponds to-night, or wait for the morning?'",
    "\"I remember staring in his face to gather his meaning; and when I did, I\r\nlaughed out loud.  The horror of that new thought-our bright, darling\r\nPeter, cold, and stark, and dead!  I remember the ring of my own laugh\r\nnow.",
    "\"The next day Deborah was at home before I was myself again.  She would\r\nnot have been so weak as to give way as I had done; but my screams (my\r\nhorrible laughter had ended in crying) had roused my sweet dear mother,\r\nwhose poor wandering wits were called back and collected as soon as a\r\nchild needed her care.  She and Deborah sat by my bedside; I knew by the\r\nlooks of each that there had been no news of Peter-no awful, ghastly\r\nnews, which was what I most had dreaded in my dull state between\r\nsleeping and waking.",
    "\"The same result of all the searching had brought something of the same\r\nrelief to my mother, to whom, I am sure, the thought that Peter might\r\neven then be hanging dead in some of the familiar home places had caused\r\nthat never-ending walk of yesterday.  Her soft eyes never were the same\r\nagain after that; they had always a restless, craving look, as if\r\nseeking for what they could not find.  Oh! it was an awful time; coming\r\ndown like a thunder-bolt on the still sunny day when the lilacs were all\r\nin bloom.\"",
    "\"Where was Mr Peter?\" said I.",
    "\"He had made his way to Liverpool; and there was war then; and some of\r\nthe king's ships lay off the mouth of the Mersey; and they were only too\r\nglad to have a fine likely boy such as him (five foot nine he was), come\r\nto offer himself.  The captain wrote to my father, and Peter wrote to my\r\nmother.  Stay! those letters will be somewhere here.\"",
    "We lighted the candle, and found the captain's letter and Peter's too.\r\nAnd we also found a little simple begging letter from Mrs Jenkyns to\r\nPeter, addressed to him at the house of an old schoolfellow whither she\r\nfancied he might have gone.  They had returned it unopened; and unopened\r\nit had remained ever since, having been inadvertently put by among the\r\nother letters of that time.  This is it:-",
    "\"MY DEAREST PETER,-You did not think we should be so sorry as we\r\n    are, I know, or you would never have gone away.  You are too good.\r\n    Your father sits and sighs till my heart aches to hear him.  He\r\n    cannot hold up his head for grief; and yet he only did what he\r\n    thought was right.  Perhaps he has been too severe, and perhaps\r\n    I have not been kind enough; but God knows how we love you, my\r\n    dear only boy.  Don looks so sorry you are gone.  Come back, and\r\n    make us happy, who love you so much.  I know you will come back.\"",
    "But Peter did not come back.  That spring day was the last time he ever\r\nsaw his mother's face.  The writer of the letter-the last-the only\r\nperson who had ever seen what was written in it, was dead long ago; and\r\nI, a stranger, not born at the time when this occurrence took place, was\r\nthe one to open it.",
    "The captain's letter summoned the father and mother to Liverpool\r\ninstantly, if they wished to see their boy; and, by some of the wild\r\nchances of life, the captain's letter had been detained somewhere,\r\nsomehow.",
    "Miss Matty went on, \"And it was racetime, and all the post-horses at\r\nCranford were gone to the races; but my father and mother set off in our\r\nown gig-and oh! my dear, they were too late-the ship was gone!  And now\r\nread Peter's letter to my mother!\"",
    "It was full of love, and sorrow, and pride in his new profession, and a\r\nsore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at Cranford; but\r\nending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before\r\nhe left the Mersey: \"Mother; we may go into battle.  I hope we shall,\r\nand lick those French: but I must see you again before that time.\"",
    "\"And she was too late,\" said Miss Matty; \"too late!\"",
    "We sat in silence, pondering on the full meaning of those sad, sad\r\nwords. At length I asked Miss Matty to tell me how her mother bore it.",
    "\"Oh!\" she said, \"she was patience itself.  She had never been strong,\r\nand this weakened her terribly.  My father used to sit looking at her:\r\nfar more sad than she was.  He seemed as if he could look at nothing\r\nelse when she was by; and he was so humble-so very gentle now.  He\r\nwould, perhaps, speak in his old way-laying down the law, as it were-and\r\nthen, in a minute or two, he would come round and put his hand on our\r\nshoulders, and ask us in a low voice, if he had said anything to hurt\r\nus. I did not wonder at his speaking so to Deborah, for she was so\r\nclever; but I could not bear to hear him talking so to me.",
    "\"But, you see, he saw what we did not-that it was killing my mother.\r\nYes! killing her (put out the candle, my dear; I can talk better in the\r\ndark), for she was but a frail woman, and ill-fitted to stand the fright\r\nand shock she had gone through; and she would smile at him and comfort\r\nhim, not in words, but in her looks and tones, which were always\r\ncheerful when he was there.  And she would speak of how she thought\r\nPeter stood a good chance of being admiral very soon-he was so brave and\r\nclever; and how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform, and what\r\nsort of hats admirals wore; and how much more fit he was to be a sailor\r\nthan a clergyman; and all in that way, just to make my father think she\r\nwas quite glad of what came of that unlucky morning's work, and the\r\nflogging which was always in his mind, as we all knew.  But oh, my dear!\r\nthe bitter, bitter crying she had when she was alone; and at last, as\r\nshe grew weaker, she could not keep her tears in when Deborah or me was\r\nby, and would give us message after message for Peter (his ship had gone\r\nto the Mediterranean, or somewhere down there, and then he was ordered\r\noff to India, and there was no overland route then); but she still said\r\nthat no one knew where their death lay in wait, and that we were not to\r\nthink hers was near.  We did not think it, but we knew it, as we saw her\r\nfading away.",
    "\"Well, my dear, it's very foolish of me, I know, when in all likelihood\r\nI am so near seeing her again.",
    "\"And only think, love! the very day after her death-for she did not live\r\nquite a twelvemonth after Peter went away-the very day after-came a\r\nparcel for her from India-from her poor boy.  It was a large, soft,\r\nwhite Indian shawl, with just a little narrow border all round; just\r\nwhat my mother would have liked.",
    "\"We thought it might rouse my father, for he had sat with her hand in\r\nhis all night long; so Deborah took it in to him, and Peter's letter to\r\nher, and all.  At first, he took no notice; and we tried to make a kind\r\nof light careless talk about the shawl, opening it out and admiring it.\r\nThen, suddenly, he got up, and spoke: 'She shall be buried in it,' he\r\nsaid; 'Peter shall have that comfort; and she would have liked it.'",
    "\"Well, perhaps it was not reasonable, but what could we do or say?  One\r\ngives people in grief their own way.  He took it up and felt it: 'It is\r\njust such a shawl as she wished for when she was married, and her mother\r\ndid not give it her.  I did not know of it till after, or she should\r\nhave had it-she should; but she shall have it now.'",
    "\"My mother looked so lovely in her death!  She was always pretty, and\r\nnow she looked fair, and waxen, and young-younger than Deborah, as she\r\nstood trembling and shivering by her.  We decked her in the long soft\r\nfolds; she lay smiling, as if pleased; and people came-all Cranford\r\ncame-to beg to see her, for they had loved her dearly, as well they\r\nmight; and the countrywomen brought posies; old Clare's wife brought\r\nsome white violets and begged they might lie on her breast.",
    "\"Deborah said to me, the day of my mother's funeral, that if she had a\r\nhundred offers she never would marry and leave my father.  It was not\r\nvery likely she would have so many-I don't know that she had one; but it\r\nwas not less to her credit to say so.  She was such a daughter to my\r\nfather as I think there never was before or since.  His eyes failed him,\r\nand she read book after book, and wrote, and copied, and was always at\r\nhis service in any parish business.  She could do many more things than\r\nmy poor mother could; she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my\r\nfather.  But he missed my mother sorely; the whole parish noticed it.\r\nNot that he was less active; I think he was more so, and more patient in\r\nhelping every one.  I did all I could to set Deborah at liberty to be\r\nwith him; for I knew I was good for little, and that my best work in the\r\nworld was to do odd jobs quietly, and set others at liberty.  But my\r\nfather was a changed man.\"",
    "\"Did Mr Peter ever come home?\"",
    "\"Yes, once.  He came home a lieutenant; he did not get to be admiral.\r\nAnd he and my father were such friends!  My father took him into every\r\nhouse in the parish, he was so proud of him.  He never walked out\r\nwithout Peter's arm to lean upon.  Deborah used to smile (I don't think\r\nwe ever laughed again after my mother's death), and say she was quite\r\nput in a corner.  Not but what my father always wanted her when there\r\nwas letter-writing or reading to be done, or anything to be settled.\"",
    "\"And then?\" said I, after a pause.",
    "\"Then Peter went to sea again; and, by-and-by, my father died, blessing\r\nus both, and thanking Deborah for all she had been to him; and, of\r\ncourse, our circumstances were changed; and, instead of living at the\r\nrectory, and keeping three maids and a man, we had to come to this small\r\nhouse, and be content with a servant-of-all-work; but, as Deborah used\r\nto say, we have always lived genteelly, even if circumstances have\r\ncompelled us to simplicity.  Poor Deborah!\"",
    "\"And Mr Peter?\" asked I.",
    "\"Oh, there was some great war in India-I forget what they call it-and we\r\nhave never heard of Peter since then.  I believe he is dead myself; and\r\nit sometimes fidgets me that we have never put on mourning for him.  And\r\nthen again, when I sit by myself, and all the house is still, I think I\r\nhear his step coming up the street, and my heart begins to flutter and\r\nbeat; but the sound always goes past-and Peter never comes.",
    "\"That's Martha back?  No!  _I'll_ go, my dear; I can always find my way\r\nin the dark, you know.  And a blow of fresh air at the door will do my\r\nhead good, and it's rather got a trick of aching.\"",
    "So she pattered off.  I had lighted the candle, to give the room a\r\ncheerful appearance against her return.",
    "\"Was it Martha?\" asked I.",
    "\"Yes.  And I am rather uncomfortable, for I heard such a strange noise,\r\njust as I was opening the door.\"",
    "\"Where?\" I asked, for her eyes were round with affright.",
    "\"In the street-just outside-it sounded like\"-",
    "\"Talking?\" I put in, as she hesitated a little.",
    "\"No! kissing\"-",
    ".\r\nVISITING",
    "ONE morning, as Miss Matty and I sat at our work-it was before twelve\r\no'clock, and Miss Matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that\r\nhad been Miss Jenkyns's best, and which Miss Matty was now wearing out\r\nin private, putting on the one made in imitation of Mrs Jamieson's at\r\nall times when she expected to be seen-Martha came up, and asked if Miss\r\nBetty Barker might speak to her mistress.  Miss Matty assented, and\r\nquickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons, while Miss Barker came\r\nupstairs; but, as she had forgotten her spectacles, and was rather\r\nflurried by the unusual time of the visit, I was not surprised to see\r\nher return with one cap on the top of the other.  She was quite\r\nunconscious of it herself, and looked at us, with bland satisfaction.\r\nNor do I think Miss Barker perceived it; for, putting aside the little\r\ncircumstance that she was not so young as she had been, she was very\r\nmuch absorbed in her errand, which she delivered herself of with an\r\noppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies.",
    "Miss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old clerk at Cranford who had\r\nofficiated in Mr Jenkyns's time.  She and her sister had had pretty good\r\nsituations as ladies' maids, and had saved money enough to set up a\r\nmilliner's shop, which had been patronised by the ladies in the\r\nneighbourhood.  Lady Arley, for instance, would occasionally give Miss\r\nBarkers the pattern of an old cap of hers, which they immediately copied\r\nand circulated among the _\u00e9lite_ of Cranford.  I say the _\u00e9lite_, for\r\nMiss Barkers had caught the trick of the place, and piqued themselves\r\nupon their \"aristocratic connection.\"  They would not sell their caps\r\nand ribbons to anyone without a pedigree.  Many a farmer's wife or\r\ndaughter turned away huffed from Miss Barkers' select millinery, and\r\nwent rather to the universal shop, where the profits of brown soap and\r\nmoist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to (Paris, he said,\r\nuntil he found his customers too patriotic and John Bullish to wear what\r\nthe Mounseers wore) London, where, as he often told his customers, Queen\r\nAdelaide had appeared, only the very week before, in a cap exactly like\r\nthe one he showed them, trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons, and had\r\nbeen complimented by King William on the becoming nature of her\r\nhead-dress.",
    "Miss Barkers, who confined themselves to truth, and did not approve of\r\nmiscellaneous customers, throve notwithstanding.  They were\r\nself-denying, good people.  Many a time have I seen the eldest of them\r\n(she that had been maid to Mrs Jamieson) carrying out some delicate mess\r\nto a poor person.  They only aped their betters in having \"nothing to\r\ndo\" with the class immediately below theirs.  And when Miss Barker died,\r\ntheir profits and income were found to be such that Miss Betty was\r\njustified in shutting up shop and retiring from business.  She also (as\r\nI think I have before said) set up her cow; a mark of respectability in\r\nCranford almost as decided as setting up a gig is among some people.\r\nShe dressed finer than any lady in Cranford; and we did not wonder at\r\nit; for it was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and\r\ncaps and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stock-in-trade.\r\nIt was five or six years since she had given up shop, so in any other\r\nplace than Cranford her dress might have been considered _pass\u00e9e_.",
    "And now Miss Betty Barker had called to invite Miss Matty to tea at her\r\nhouse on the following Tuesday.  She gave me also an impromptu\r\ninvitation, as I happened to be a visitor-though I could see she had a\r\nlittle fear lest, since my father had gone to live in Drumble, he might\r\nhave engaged in that \"horrid cotton trade,\" and so dragged his family\r\ndown out of \"aristocratic society.\"  She prefaced this invitation with\r\nso many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity.  \"Her\r\npresumption\" was to be excused.  What had she been doing?  She seemed so\r\noverpowered by it I could only think that she had been writing to Queen\r\nAdelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace; but the act which she so\r\ncharacterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sister's\r\nformer mistress, Mrs Jamieson.  \"Her former occupation considered, could\r\nMiss Matty excuse the liberty?\"  Ah! thought I, she has found out that\r\ndouble cap, and is going to rectify Miss Matty's head-dress.  No! it was\r\nsimply to extend her invitation to Miss Matty and to me.  Miss Matty\r\nbowed acceptance; and I wondered that, in the graceful action, she did\r\nnot feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her head-dress.\r\nBut I do not think she did, for she recovered her balance, and went on\r\ntalking to Miss Betty in a kind, condescending manner, very different\r\nfrom the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how\r\nsingular her appearance was.  \"Mrs Jamieson is coming, I think you\r\nsaid?\" asked Miss Matty.",
    "\"Yes.  Mrs Jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be\r\nhappy to come.  One little stipulation she made, that she should bring\r\nCarlo.  I told her that if I had a weakness, it was for dogs.\"",
    "\"And Miss Pole?\" questioned Miss Matty, who was thinking of her pool at\r\nPreference, in which Carlo would not be available as a partner.",
    "\"I am going to ask Miss Pole.  Of course, I could not think of asking\r\nher until I had asked you, madam-the rector's daughter, madam.  Believe\r\nme, I do not forget the situation my father held under yours.\"",
    "\"And Mrs Forrester, of course?\"",
    "\"And Mrs Forrester.  I thought, in fact, of going to her before I went\r\nto Miss Pole.  Although her circumstances are changed, madam, she was\r\nborn at Tyrrell, and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of\r\nBigelow Hall.\"",
    "Miss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a\r\nvery good card-player.",
    "\"Mrs Fitz-Adam-I suppose\"-",
    "\"No, madam.  I must draw a line somewhere.  Mrs Jamieson would not, I\r\nthink, like to meet Mrs Fitz-Adam.  I have the greatest respect for Mrs\r\nFitz-Adam-but I cannot think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs\r\nJamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns.\"",
    "Miss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty, and pursed up her mouth.  She\r\nlooked at me with sidelong dignity, as much as to say, although a\r\nretired milliner, she was no democrat, and understood the difference of\r\nranks.",
    "\"May I beg you to come as near half-past six to my little dwelling, as\r\npossible, Miss Matilda?  Mrs Jamieson dines at five, but has kindly\r\npromised not to delay her visit beyond that time-half-past six.\"  And\r\nwith a swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave.",
    "My prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss Pole, who\r\nusually came to call on Miss Matilda after any event-or indeed in sight\r\nof any event-to talk it over with her.",
    "\"Miss Betty told me it was to be a choice and select few,\" said Miss\r\nPole, as she and Miss Matty compared notes.",
    "\"Yes, so she said.  Not even Mrs Fitz-Adam.\"",
    "Now Mrs Fitz-Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford surgeon, whom I\r\nhave named before.  Their parents were respectable farmers, content with\r\ntheir station.  The name of these good people was Hoggins.  Mr Hoggins\r\nwas the Cranford doctor now; we disliked the name and considered it\r\ncoarse; but, as Miss Jenkyns said, if he changed it to Piggins it would\r\nnot be much better.  We had hoped to discover a relationship between him\r\nand that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins; but the\r\nman, careless of his own interests, utterly ignored and denied any such\r\nrelationship, although, as dear Miss Jenkyns had said, he had a sister\r\ncalled Mary, and the same Christian names were very apt to run in\r\nfamilies.",
    "Soon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz-Adam, she disappeared from\r\nthe neighbourhood for many years.  She did not move in a sphere in\r\nCranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what\r\nMr Fitz-Adam was.  He died and was gathered to his fathers without our\r\never having thought about him at all.  And then Mrs Fitz-Adam reappeared\r\nin Cranford (\"as bold as a lion,\" Miss Pole said), a well-to-do widow,\r\ndressed in rustling black silk, so soon after her husband's death that\r\npoor Miss Jenkyns was justified in the remark she made, that \"bombazine\r\nwould have shown a deeper sense of her loss.\"",
    "I remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or\r\nnot Mrs Fitz-Adam should be called upon by the old blue-blooded\r\ninhabitants of Cranford.  She had taken a large rambling house, which\r\nhad been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its\r\ntenant, because, once upon a time, seventy or eighty years before, the\r\nspinster daughter of an earl had resided in it.  I am not sure if the\r\ninhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power\r\nof intellect; for the earl's daughter, Lady Jane, had a sister, Lady\r\nAnne, who had married a general officer in the time of the American war,\r\nand this general officer had written one or two comedies, which were\r\nstill acted on the London boards, and which, when we saw them\r\nadvertised, made us all draw up, and feel that Drury Lane was paying a\r\nvery pretty compliment to Cranford.  Still, it was not at all a settled\r\nthing that Mrs Fitz-Adam was to be visited, when dear Miss Jenkyns died;\r\nand, with her, something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of\r\ngentility went out too.  As Miss Pole observed, \"As most of the ladies\r\nof good family in Cranford were elderly spinsters, or widows without\r\nchildren, if we did not relax a little, and become less exclusive,\r\nby-and-by we should have no society at all.\"",
    "Mrs Forrester continued on the same side.",
    "\"She had always understood that Fitz meant something aristocratic; there\r\nwas Fitz-Roy-she thought that some of the King's children had been\r\ncalled Fitz-Roy; and there was Fitz-Clarence, now-they were the children\r\nof dear good King William the Fourth.  Fitz-Adam!-it was a pretty name,\r\nand she thought it very probably meant 'Child of Adam.'  No one, who had\r\nnot some good blood in their veins, would dare to be called Fitz; there\r\nwas a deal in a name-she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two\r\nlittle ffs-ffoulkes-and he always looked down upon capital letters and\r\nsaid they belonged to lately-invented families.  She had been afraid he\r\nwould die a bachelor, he was so very choice.  When he met with a Mrs\r\nffarringdon, at a watering-place, he took to her immediately; and a very\r\npretty genteel woman she was-a widow, with a very good fortune; and 'my\r\ncousin,' Mr ffoulkes, married her; and it was all owing to her two\r\nlittle ffs.\"",
    "Mrs Fitz-Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr Fitz-anything\r\nin Cranford, so that could not have been her motive for settling there.\r\nMiss Matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into\r\nthe society of the place, which would certainly be a very agreeable rise\r\nfor _ci-devant_ Miss Hoggins; and if this had been her hope it would be\r\ncruel to disappoint her.",
    "So everybody called upon Mrs Fitz-Adam-everybody but Mrs Jamieson, who\r\nused to show how honourable she was by never seeing Mrs Fitz-Adam when\r\nthey met at the Cranford parties.  There would be only eight or ten\r\nladies in the room, and Mrs Fitz-Adam was the largest of all, and she\r\ninvariably used to stand up when Mrs Jamieson came in, and curtsey very\r\nlow to her whenever she turned in her direction-so low, in fact, that I\r\nthink Mrs Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her, for she never\r\nmoved a muscle of her face, no more than if she had not seen her.  Still\r\nMrs Fitz-Adam persevered.",
    "The spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four\r\nladies in calashes met at Miss Barker's door.  Do you know what a\r\ncalash is?  It is a covering worn over caps, not unlike the heads\r\nfastened on old-fashioned gigs; but sometimes it is not quite so large.\r\nThis kind of head-gear always made an awful impression on the children\r\nin Cranford; and now two or three left off their play in the quiet\r\nsunny little street, and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole,\r\nMiss Matty, and myself.  We were silent too, so that we could hear\r\nloud, suppressed whispers inside Miss Barker's house: \"Wait, Peggy! wait\r\ntill I've run upstairs and washed my hands.  When I cough, open the\r\ndoor; I'll not be a minute.\"",
    "And, true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise, between a\r\nsneeze and a crow; on which the door flew open.  Behind it stood a\r\nround-eyed maiden, all aghast at the honourable company of calashes, who\r\nmarched in without a word.  She recovered presence of mind enough to\r\nusher us into a small room, which had been the shop, but was now\r\nconverted into a temporary dressing-room.  There we unpinned and shook\r\nourselves, and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and\r\ngracious company-face; and then, bowing backwards with \"After you,\r\nma'am,\" we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence up the narrow\r\nstaircase that led to Miss Barker's drawing-room.  There she sat, as\r\nstately and composed as though we had never heard that odd-sounding\r\ncough, from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough.\r\nKind, gentle, shabbily-dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted\r\nto the second place of honour-a seat arranged something like Prince\r\nAlbert's near the Queen's-good, but not so good.  The place of\r\npre-eminence was, of course, reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson,\r\nwho presently came panting up the stairs-Carlo rushing round her on her\r\nprogress, as if he meant to trip her up.",
    "And now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman!  She stirred the\r\nfire, and shut the door, and sat as near to it as she could, quite on\r\nthe edge of her chair.  When Peggy came in, tottering under the weight\r\nof the tea-tray, I noticed that Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy\r\nshould not keep her distance sufficiently.  She and her mistress were on\r\nvery familiar terms in their every-day intercourse, and Peggy wanted now\r\nto make several little confidences to her, which Miss Barker was on\r\nthorns to hear, but which she thought it her duty, as a lady, to\r\nrepress.  So she turned away from all Peggy's asides and signs; but she\r\nmade one or two very malapropos answers to what was said; and at last,\r\nseized with a bright idea, she exclaimed, \"Poor, sweet Carlo!  I'm\r\nforgetting him. Come downstairs with me, poor ittie doggie, and it shall\r\nhave its tea, it shall!\"",
    "In a few minutes she returned, bland and benignant as before; but I\r\nthought she had forgotten to give the \"poor ittie doggie\" anything to\r\neat, judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces\r\nof cake.  The tea-tray was abundantly loaded-I was pleased to see it, I\r\nwas so hungry; but I was afraid the ladies present might think it\r\nvulgarly heaped up.  I know they would have done at their own houses;\r\nbut somehow the heaps disappeared here.  I saw Mrs Jamieson eating\r\nseed-cake, slowly and considerately, as she did everything; and I was\r\nrather surprised, for I knew she had told us, on the occasion of her\r\nlast party, that she never had it in her house, it reminded her so much\r\nof scented soap.  She always gave us Savoy biscuits.  However, Mrs\r\nJamieson was kindly indulgent to Miss Barker's want of knowledge of the\r\ncustoms of high life; and, to spare her feelings, ate three large pieces\r\nof seed-cake, with a placid, ruminating expression of countenance, not\r\nunlike a cow's.",
    "After tea there was some little demur and difficulty.  We were six in\r\nnumber; four could play at Preference, and for the other two there was\r\nCribbage.  But all, except myself (I was rather afraid of the Cranford\r\nladies at cards, for it was the most earnest and serious business they\r\never engaged in), were anxious to be of the \"pool.\"  Even Miss Barker,\r\nwhile declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille, was evidently\r\nhankering to take a hand.  The dilemma was soon put an end to by a\r\nsingular kind of noise.  If a baron's daughter-in-law could ever be\r\nsupposed to snore, I should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then; for,\r\novercome by the heat of the room, and inclined to doze by nature, the\r\ntemptation of that very comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her,\r\nand Mrs Jamieson was nodding.  Once or twice she opened her eyes with an\r\neffort, and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us; but by-and-by, even\r\nher benevolence was not equal to this exertion, and she was sound\r\nasleep.",
    "[Picture: The temptation of the comfortable arm-chair had been too much\r\n                                 for her]",
    "\"It is very gratifying to me,\" whispered Miss Barker at the card-table\r\nto her three opponents, whom, notwithstanding her ignorance of the game,\r\nshe was \"basting\" most unmercifully-\"very gratifying indeed, to see how\r\ncompletely Mrs Jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling; she\r\ncould not have paid me a greater compliment.\"",
    "Miss Barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or\r\nfour handsomely-bound fashion-books ten or twelve years old, observing,\r\nas she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit, that she\r\nknew young people liked to look at pictures.  Carlo lay and snorted, and\r\nstarted at his mistress's feet.  He, too, was quite at home.",
    "The card-table was an animated scene to watch; four ladies' heads, with\r\nniddle-noddling caps, all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in\r\ntheir eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough: and every now\r\nand then came Miss Barker's \"Hush, ladies! if you please, hush!  Mrs\r\nJamieson is asleep.\"",
    "It was very difficult to steer clear between Mrs Forrester's deafness\r\nand Mrs Jamieson's sleepiness.  But Miss Barker managed her arduous task\r\nwell.  She repeated the whisper to Mrs Forrester, distorting her face\r\nconsiderably, in order to show, by the motions of her lips, what was\r\nsaid; and then she smiled kindly all round at us, and murmured to\r\nherself, \"Very gratifying, indeed; I wish my poor sister had been alive\r\nto see this day.\"",
    "Presently the door was thrown wide open; Carlo started to his feet, with\r\na loud snapping bark, and Mrs Jamieson awoke: or, perhaps, she had not\r\nbeen asleep-as she said almost directly, the room had been so light she\r\nhad been glad to keep her eyes shut, but had been listening with great\r\ninterest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation.  Peggy came in\r\nonce more, red with importance.  Another tray!  \"Oh, gentility!\" thought\r\nI, \"can you endure this last shock?\"  For Miss Barker had ordered (nay,\r\nI doubt not, prepared, although she did say, \"Why, Peggy, what have you\r\nbrought us?\" and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure)\r\nall sorts of good things for supper-scalloped oysters, potted lobsters,\r\njelly, a dish called \"little Cupids\" (which was in great favour with the\r\nCranford ladies, although too expensive to be given, except on solemn\r\nand state occasions-macaroons sopped in brandy, I should have called it,\r\nif I had not known its more refined and classical name).  In short, we\r\nwere evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best; and\r\nwe thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our\r\ngentility-which never ate suppers in general, but which, like most\r\nnon-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.",
    "Miss Barker, in her former sphere, had, I daresay, been made acquainted\r\nwith the beverage they call cherry-brandy.  We none of us had ever seen\r\nsuch a thing, and rather shrank back when she proffered it us-\"just a\r\nlittle, leetle glass, ladies; after the oysters and lobsters, you know.\r\nShell-fish are sometimes thought not very wholesome.\"  We all shook our\r\nheads like female mandarins; but, at last, Mrs Jamieson suffered herself\r\nto be persuaded, and we followed her lead.  It was not exactly\r\nunpalatable, though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound\r\nto give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing\r\nterribly-almost as strangely as Miss Barker had done, before we were\r\nadmitted by Peggy.",
    "\"It's very strong,\" said Miss Pole, as she put down her empty glass; \"I\r\ndo believe there's spirit in it.\"",
    "\"Only a little drop-just necessary to make it keep,\" said Miss Barker.\r\n\"You know we put brandy-pepper over our preserves to make them keep.  I\r\noften feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart.\"",
    "I question whether damson tart would have opened Mrs Jamieson's heart as\r\nthe cherry-brandy did; but she told us of a coming event, respecting\r\nwhich she had been quite silent till that moment.",
    "\"My sister-in-law, Lady Glenmire, is coming to stay with me.\"",
    "There was a chorus of \"Indeed!\" and then a pause.  Each one rapidly\r\nreviewed her wardrobe, as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a\r\nbaron's widow; for, of course, a series of small festivals were always\r\nheld in Cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends'\r\nhouses.  We felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion.",
    "Not long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced.  Mrs\r\nJamieson had the sedan-chair, which had squeezed itself into Miss\r\nBarker's narrow lobby with some difficulty, and most literally \"stopped\r\nthe way.\"  It required some skilful manoeuvring on the part of the old\r\nchairmen (shoemakers by day, but when summoned to carry the sedan\r\ndressed up in a strange old livery-long great-coats, with small capes,\r\ncoeval with the sedan, and similar to the dress of the class in\r\nHogarth's pictures) to edge, and back, and try at it again, and finally\r\nto succeed in carrying their burden out of Miss Barker's front door.\r\nThen we heard their quick pit-a-pat along the quiet little street as we\r\nput on our calashes and pinned up our gowns; Miss Barker hovering about\r\nus with offers of help, which, if she had not remembered her former\r\noccupation, and wished us to forget it, would have been much more\r\npressing.",
    ".\r\n\"YOUR LADYSHIP\"",
    "EARLY the next morning-directly after twelve-Miss Pole made her\r\nappearance at Miss Matty's.  Some very trifling piece of business was\r\nalleged as a reason for the call; but there was evidently something\r\nbehind.  At last out it came.",
    "\"By the way, you'll think I'm strangely ignorant; but, do you really\r\nknow, I am puzzled how we ought to address Lady Glenmire.  Do you say,\r\n'Your Ladyship,' where you would say 'you' to a common person?  I have\r\nbeen puzzling all morning; and are we to say 'My Lady,' instead of\r\n'Ma'am?'  Now you knew Lady Arley-will you kindly tell me the most\r\ncorrect way of speaking to the peerage?\"",
    "Poor Miss Matty! she took off her spectacles and she put them on\r\nagain-but how Lady Arley was addressed, she could not remember.",
    "\"It is so long ago,\" she said.  \"Dear! dear! how stupid I am!  I don't\r\nthink I ever saw her more than twice.  I know we used to call Sir Peter,\r\n'Sir Peter'-but he came much oftener to see us than Lady Arley did.\r\nDeborah would have known in a minute.  'My lady'-'your ladyship.'  It\r\nsounds very strange, and as if it was not natural.  I never thought of\r\nit before; but, now you have named it, I am all in a puzzle.\"",
    "It was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision from Miss\r\nMatty, who got more bewildered every moment, and more perplexed as to\r\netiquettes of address.",
    "\"Well, I really think,\" said Miss Pole, \"I had better just go and tell\r\nMrs Forrester about our little difficulty.  One sometimes grows nervous;\r\nand yet one would not have Lady Glenmire think we were quite ignorant of\r\nthe etiquettes of high life in Cranford.\"",
    "\"And will you just step in here, dear Miss Pole, as you come back,\r\nplease, and tell me what you decide upon?  Whatever you and Mrs\r\nForrester fix upon, will be quite right, I'm sure.  'Lady Arley,' 'Sir\r\nPeter,'\" said Miss Matty to herself, trying to recall the old forms of\r\nwords.",
    "\"Who is Lady Glenmire?\" asked I.",
    "\"Oh, she's the widow of Mr Jamieson-that's Mrs Jamieson's late husband,\r\nyou know-widow of his eldest brother.  Mrs Jamieson was a Miss Walker,\r\ndaughter of Governor Walker.  'Your ladyship.'  My dear, if they fix on\r\nthat way of speaking, you must just let me practice a little on you\r\nfirst, for I shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to\r\nLady Glenmire.\"",
    "It was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on a very\r\nunpolite errand.  I notice that apathetic people have more quiet\r\nimpertinence than others; and Mrs Jamieson came now to insinuate pretty\r\nplainly that she did not particularly wish that the Cranford ladies\r\nshould call upon her sister-in-law.  I can hardly say how she made this\r\nclear; for I grew very indignant and warm, while with slow deliberation\r\nshe was explaining her wishes to Miss Matty, who, a true lady herself,\r\ncould hardly understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to\r\nappear to her noble sister-in-law as if she only visited \"county\"\r\nfamilies.  Miss Matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after I had\r\nfound out the object of Mrs Jamieson's visit.",
    "When she did understand the drift of the honourable lady's call, it was\r\npretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus\r\nuncourteously given.  She was not in the least hurt-she was of too\r\ngentle a spirit for that; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving\r\nof Mrs Jamieson's conduct; but there was something of this feeling in\r\nher mind, I am sure, which made her pass from the subject to others in a\r\nless flurried and more composed manner than usual.  Mrs Jamieson was,\r\nindeed, the more flurried of the two, and I could see she was glad to\r\ntake her leave.",
    "A little while afterwards Miss Pole returned, red and indignant.  \"Well!\r\nto be sure!  You've had Mrs Jamieson here, I find from Martha; and we\r\nare not to call on Lady Glenmire.  Yes!  I met Mrs Jamieson, half-way\r\nbetween here and Mrs Forrester's, and she told me; she took me so by\r\nsurprise, I had nothing to say.  I wish I had thought of something very\r\nsharp and sarcastic; I dare say I shall to-night.  And Lady Glenmire is\r\nbut the widow of a Scotch baron after all!  I went on to look at Mrs\r\nForrester's Peerage, to see who this lady was, that is to be kept under\r\na glass case: widow of a Scotch peer-never sat in the House of Lords-and\r\nas poor as Job, I dare say; and she-fifth daughter of some Mr Campbell\r\nor other. You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to\r\nthe Arleys; and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one\r\nsays.\"",
    "Miss Matty tried to soothe Miss Pole, but in vain.  That lady, usually\r\nso kind and good-humoured, was now in a full flow of anger.",
    "\"And I went and ordered a cap this morning, to be quite ready,\" said she\r\nat last, letting out the secret which gave sting to Mrs Jamieson's\r\nintimation.  \"Mrs Jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make\r\nfourth at a pool when she has none of her fine Scotch relations with\r\nher!\"",
    "In coming out of church, the first Sunday on which Lady Glenmire\r\nappeared in Cranford, we sedulously talked together, and turned our\r\nbacks on Mrs Jamieson and her guest.  If we might not call on her, we\r\nwould not even look at her, though we were dying with curiosity to know\r\nwhat she was like.  We had the comfort of questioning Martha in the\r\nafternoon.  Martha did not belong to a sphere of society whose\r\nobservation could be an implied compliment to Lady Glenmire, and Martha\r\nhad made good use of her eyes.",
    "\"Well, ma'am! is it the little lady with Mrs Jamieson, you mean?  I\r\nthought you would like more to know how young Mrs Smith was dressed; her\r\nbeing a bride.\"  (Mrs Smith was the butcher's wife).",
    "Miss Pole said, \"Good gracious me! as if we cared about a Mrs Smith;\"\r\nbut was silent as Martha resumed her speech.",
    "\"The little lady in Mrs Jamieson's pew had on, ma'am, rather an old\r\nblack silk, and a shepherd's plaid cloak, ma'am, and very bright black\r\neyes she had, ma'am, and a pleasant, sharp face; not over young, ma'am,\r\nbut yet, I should guess, younger than Mrs Jamieson herself.  She looked\r\nup and down the church, like a bird, and nipped up her petticoats, when\r\nshe came out, as quick and sharp as ever I see.  I'll tell you what,\r\nma'am, she's more like Mrs Deacon, at the 'Coach and Horses,' nor any\r\none.\"",
    "\"Hush, Martha!\" said Miss Matty, \"that's not respectful.\"",
    "\"Isn't it, ma'am?  I beg pardon, I'm sure; but Jem Hearn said so as\r\nwell. He said, she was just such a sharp, stirring sort of a body\"-",
    "\"Lady,\" said Miss Pole.",
    "\"Lady-as Mrs Deacon.\"",
    "Another Sunday passed away, and we still averted our eyes from Mrs\r\nJamieson and her guest, and made remarks to ourselves that we thought\r\nwere very severe-almost too much so.  Miss Matty was evidently uneasy at\r\nour sarcastic manner of speaking.",
    "Perhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs Jamieson's was\r\nnot the gayest, liveliest house in the world; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had\r\nfound out that most of the county families were in London, and that\r\nthose who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have\r\nbeen to the circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood.\r\nGreat events spring out of small causes; so I will not pretend to say\r\nwhat induced Mrs Jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the\r\nCranford ladies, and send notes of invitation all round for a small\r\nparty on the following Tuesday.  Mr Mulliner himself brought them round.\r\n He _would_ always ignore the fact of there being a back door to any\r\nhouse, and gave a louder rat-tat than his mistress, Mrs Jamieson.  He\r\nhad three little notes, which he carried in a large basket, in order to\r\nimpress his mistress with an idea of their great weight, though they\r\nmight easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket.",
    "Miss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous\r\nengagement at home: it was the evening on which Miss Matty usually made\r\ncandle-lighters of all the notes and letters of the week; for on Mondays\r\nher accounts were always made straight-not a penny owing from the week\r\nbefore; so, by a natural arrangement, making candle-lighters fell upon a\r\nTuesday evening, and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs\r\nJamieson's invitation.  But before our answer was written, in came Miss\r\nPole, with an open note in her hand.",
    "\"So!\" she said.  \"Ah!  I see you have got your note, too.  Better late\r\nthan never.  I could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough\r\nof our society before a fortnight was over.\"",
    "\"Yes,\" said Miss Matty, \"we're asked for Tuesday evening.  And perhaps\r\nyou would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that\r\nnight.  It is my usual regular time for looking over the last week's\r\nbills, and notes, and letters, and making candle-lighters of them; but\r\nthat does not seem quite reason enough for saying I have a previous\r\nengagement at home, though I meant to make it do.  Now, if you would\r\ncome, my conscience would be quite at ease, and luckily the note is not\r\nwritten yet.\"",
    "I saw Miss Pole's countenance change while Miss Matty was speaking.",
    "\"Don't you mean to go then?\" asked she.",
    "\"Oh, no!\" said, Miss Matty quietly.  \"You don't either, I suppose?\"",
    "\"I don't know,\" replied Miss Pole.  \"Yes, I think I do,\" said she,\r\nrather briskly; and on seeing Miss Matty look surprised, she added, \"You\r\nsee, one would not like Mrs Jamieson to think that anything she could\r\ndo, or say, was of consequence enough to give offence; it would be a\r\nkind of letting down of ourselves, that I, for one, should not like.  It\r\nwould be too flattering to Mrs Jamieson if we allowed her to suppose\r\nthat what she had said affected us a week, nay ten days afterwards.\"",
    "\"Well!  I suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about\r\nanything; and, perhaps, after all, she did not mean to vex us.  But I\r\nmust say, I could not have brought myself to say the things Mrs Jamieson\r\ndid about our not calling.  I really don't think I shall go.\"",
    "\"Oh, come!  Miss Matty, you must go; you know our friend Mrs Jamieson is\r\nmuch more phlegmatic than most people, and does not enter into the\r\nlittle delicacies of feeling which you possess in so remarkable a\r\ndegree.\"",
    "\"I thought you possessed them, too, that day Mrs Jamieson called to tell\r\nus not to go,\" said Miss Matty innocently.",
    "But Miss Pole, in addition to her delicacies of feeling, possessed a\r\nvery smart cap, which she was anxious to show to an admiring world; and\r\nso she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight\r\nbefore, and to be ready to act on what she called the great Christian\r\nprinciple of \"Forgive and forget\"; and she lectured dear Miss Matty so\r\nlong on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her\r\nduty, as a deceased rector's daughter, to buy a new cap and go to the\r\nparty at Mrs Jamieson's.  So \"we were most happy to accept,\" instead of\r\n\"regretting that we were obliged to decline.\"",
    "[Picture: Mr Mulliner]",
    "The expenditure on dress in Cranford was principally in that one article\r\nreferred to.  If the heads were buried in smart new caps, the ladies\r\nwere like ostriches, and cared not what became of their bodies.  Old\r\ngowns, white and venerable collars, any number of brooches, up and down\r\nand everywhere (some with dogs' eyes painted in them; some that were\r\nlike small picture-frames with mausoleums and weeping-willows neatly\r\nexecuted in hair inside; some, again, with miniatures of ladies and\r\ngentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin), old brooches\r\nfor a permanent ornament, and new caps to suit the fashion of the\r\nday-the ladies of Cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and\r\npropriety, as Miss Barker once prettily expressed it.",
    "And with three new caps, and a greater array of brooches than had ever\r\nbeen seen together at one time since Cranford was a town, did Mrs\r\nForrester, and Miss Matty, and Miss Pole appear on that memorable\r\nTuesday evening.  I counted seven brooches myself on Miss Pole's dress.\r\nTwo were fixed negligently in her cap (one was a butterfly made of\r\nScotch pebbles, which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real\r\ninsect); one fastened her net neckerchief; one her collar; one\r\nornamented the front of her gown, midway between her throat and waist;\r\nand another adorned the point of her stomacher.  Where the seventh was I\r\nhave forgotten, but it was somewhere about her, I am sure.",
    "But I am getting on too fast, in describing the dresses of the company.\r\nI should first relate the gathering on the way to Mrs Jamieson's.  That\r\nlady lived in a large house just outside the town.  A road which had\r\nknown what it was to be a street ran right before the house, which\r\nopened out upon it without any intervening garden or court.  Whatever\r\nthe sun was about, he never shone on the front of that house.  To be\r\nsure, the living-rooms were at the back, looking on to a pleasant\r\ngarden; the front windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers'\r\nrooms, and pantries, and in one of them Mr Mulliner was reported to sit.\r\n Indeed, looking askance, we often saw the back of a head covered with\r\nhair powder, which also extended itself over his coat-collar down to his\r\nvery waist; and this imposing back was always engaged in reading the _St\r\nJames's Chronicle_, opened wide, which, in some degree, accounted for\r\nthe length of time the said newspaper was in reaching us-equal\r\nsubscribers with Mrs Jamieson, though, in right of her honourableness,\r\nshe always had the reading of it first.  This very Tuesday, the delay in\r\nforwarding the last number had been particularly aggravating; just when\r\nboth Miss Pole and Miss Matty, the former more especially, had been\r\nwanting to see it, in order to coach up the Court news ready for the\r\nevening's interview with aristocracy.  Miss Pole told us she had\r\nabsolutely taken time by the forelock, and been dressed by five o'clock,\r\nin order to be ready if the _St James's Chronicle_ should come in at the\r\nlast moment-the very _St James's Chronicle_ which the powdered head was\r\ntranquilly and composedly reading as we passed the accustomed window\r\nthis evening.",
    "\"The impudence of the man!\" said Miss Pole, in a low indignant whisper.\r\n\"I should like to ask him whether his mistress pays her quarter-share\r\nfor his exclusive use.\"",
    "We looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought; for Mr\r\nMulliner was an object of great awe to all of us.  He seemed never to\r\nhave forgotten his condescension in coming to live at Cranford.  Miss\r\nJenkyns, at times, had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex,\r\nand spoken to him on terms of equality; but even Miss Jenkyns could get\r\nno higher.  In his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a\r\nsulky cockatoo.  He did not speak except in gruff monosyllables.  He\r\nwould wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait, and then look\r\ndeeply offended because we had kept him there, while, with trembling,\r\nhasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company.",
    "Miss Pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs, intended, though\r\naddressed to us, to afford Mr Mulliner some slight amusement.  We all\r\nsmiled, in order to seem as if we felt at our ease, and timidly looked\r\nfor Mr Mulliner's sympathy.  Not a muscle of that wooden face had\r\nrelaxed; and we were grave in an instant.",
    "Mrs Jamieson's drawing-room was cheerful; the evening sun came streaming\r\ninto it, and the large square window was clustered round with flowers.\r\nThe furniture was white and gold; not the later style, Louis Quatorze, I\r\nthink they call it, all shells and twirls; no, Mrs Jamieson's chairs and\r\ntables had not a curve or bend about them.  The chair and table legs\r\ndiminished as they neared the ground, and were straight and square in\r\nall their corners.  The chairs were all a-row against the walls, with\r\nthe exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire.\r\nThey were railed with white bars across the back and knobbed with gold;\r\nneither the railings nor the knobs invited to ease.  There was a\r\njapanned table devoted to literature, on which lay a Bible, a Peerage,\r\nand a Prayer-Book.  There was another square Pembroke table dedicated to\r\nthe Fine Arts, on which were a kaleidoscope, conversation-cards,\r\npuzzle-cards (tied together to an interminable length with faded pink\r\nsatin ribbon), and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which\r\ndecorate tea-chests.  Carlo lay on the worsted-worked rug, and\r\nungraciously barked at us as we entered.  Mrs Jamieson stood up, giving\r\nus each a torpid smile of welcome, and looking helplessly beyond us at\r\nMr Mulliner, as if she hoped he would place us in chairs, for, if he did\r\nnot, she never could.  I suppose he thought we could find our way to the\r\ncircle round the fire, which reminded me of Stonehenge, I don't know\r\nwhy.  Lady Glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess, and, somehow or\r\nother, we found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably, and not\r\nformally, in Mrs Jamieson's house.  Lady Glenmire, now we had time to\r\nlook at her, proved to be a bright little woman of middle age, who had\r\nbeen very pretty in the days of her youth, and who was even yet very\r\npleasant-looking.  I saw Miss Pole appraising her dress in the first\r\nfive minutes, and I take her word when she said the next day-",
    "\"My dear! ten pounds would have purchased every stitch she had on-lace\r\nand all.\"",
    "It was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor, and partly\r\nreconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the House of\r\nLords; which, when we first heard of it, seemed a kind of swindling us\r\nout of our prospects on false pretences; a sort of \"A Lord and No Lord\"\r\nbusiness.",
    "We were all very silent at first.  We were thinking what we could talk\r\nabout, that should be high enough to interest My Lady.  There had been a\r\nrise in the price of sugar, which, as preserving-time was near, was a\r\npiece of intelligence to all our house-keeping hearts, and would have\r\nbeen the natural topic if Lady Glenmire had not been by.  But we were\r\nnot sure if the peerage ate preserves-much less knew how they were made.\r\n At last, Miss Pole, who had always a great deal of courage and _savoir\r\nfaire_, spoke to Lady Glenmire, who on her part had seemed just as much\r\npuzzled to know how to break the silence as we were.",
    "\"Has your ladyship been to Court lately?\" asked she; and then gave a\r\nlittle glance round at us, half timid and half triumphant, as much as to\r\nsay, \"See how judiciously I have chosen a subject befitting the rank of\r\nthe stranger.\"",
    "\"I never was there in my life,\" said Lady Glenmire, with a broad Scotch\r\naccent, but in a very sweet voice.  And then, as if she had been too\r\nabrupt, she added: \"We very seldom went to London-only twice, in fact,\r\nduring all my married life; and before I was married my father had far\r\ntoo large a family\" (fifth daughter of Mr Campbell was in all our minds,\r\nI am sure) \"to take us often from our home, even to Edinburgh.  Ye'll\r\nhave been in Edinburgh, maybe?\" said she, suddenly brightening up with\r\nthe hope of a common interest.  We had none of us been there; but Miss\r\nPole had an uncle who once had passed a night there, which was very\r\npleasant.",
    "Mrs Jamieson, meanwhile, was absorbed in wonder why Mr Mulliner did not\r\nbring the tea; and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth.",
    "\"I had better ring the bell, my dear, had not I?\" said Lady Glenmire\r\nbriskly.",
    "\"No-I think not-Mulliner does not like to be hurried.\"",
    "We should have liked our tea, for we dined at an earlier hour than Mrs\r\nJamieson.  I suspect Mr Mulliner had to finish the _St James's\r\nChronicle_ before he chose to trouble himself about tea.  His mistress\r\nfidgeted and fidgeted, and kept saying, \"I can't think why Mulliner does\r\nnot bring tea.  I can't think what he can be about.\"  And Lady Glenmire\r\nat last grew quite impatient, but it was a pretty kind of impatience\r\nafter all; and she rang the bell rather sharply, on receiving a\r\nhalf-permission from her sister-in-law to do so.  Mr Mulliner appeared\r\nin dignified surprise. \"Oh!\" said Mrs Jamieson, \"Lady Glenmire rang the\r\nbell; I believe it was for tea.\"",
    "In a few minutes tea was brought.  Very delicate was the china, very old\r\nthe plate, very thin the bread and butter, and very small the lumps of\r\nsugar.  Sugar was evidently Mrs Jamieson's favourite economy.  I\r\nquestion if the little filigree sugar-tongs, made something like\r\nscissors, could have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest,\r\nvulgar good-sized piece; and when I tried to seize two little minnikin\r\npieces at once, so as not to be detected in too many returns to the\r\nsugar-basin, they absolutely dropped one, with a little sharp clatter,\r\nquite in a malicious and unnatural manner.  But before this happened we\r\nhad had a slight disappointment.  In the little silver jug was cream, in\r\nthe larger one was milk.  As soon as Mr Mulliner came in, Carlo began to\r\nbeg, which was a thing our manners forbade us to do, though I am sure we\r\nwere just as hungry; and Mrs Jamieson said she was certain we would\r\nexcuse her if she gave her poor dumb Carlo his tea first.  She\r\naccordingly mixed a saucerful for him, and put it down for him to lap;\r\nand then she told us how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow\r\nwas; he knew cream quite well, and constantly refused tea with only milk\r\nin it: so the milk was left for us; but we silently thought we were\r\nquite as intelligent and sensible as Carlo, and felt as if insult were\r\nadded to injury when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced\r\nby his wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours.",
    "After tea we thawed down into common-life subjects.  We were thankful to\r\nLady Glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter, and this\r\nmutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have\r\nbeen with talking about the Court, though Miss Pole did say she had\r\nhoped to know how the dear Queen was from some one who had seen her.",
    "The friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards.  Lady\r\nGlenmire played Preference to admiration, and was a complete authority\r\nas to Ombre and Quadrille.  Even Miss Pole quite forgot to say \"my\r\nlady,\" and \"your ladyship,\" and said \"Basto! ma'am\"; \"you have Spadille,\r\nI believe,\" just as quietly as if we had never held the great Cranford\r\nParliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress.",
    "As a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the\r\npresence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet, instead\r\nof a cap, on her head, Mrs Forrester related a curious little fact to\r\nLady Glenmire-an anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends,\r\nbut of which even Mrs Jamieson was not aware.  It related to some fine\r\nold lace, the sole relic of better days, which Lady Glenmire was\r\nadmiring on Mrs Forrester's collar.",
    "\"Yes,\" said that lady, \"such lace cannot be got now for either love or\r\nmoney; made by the nuns abroad, they tell me.  They say that they can't\r\nmake it now even there.  But perhaps they can, now they've passed the\r\nCatholic Emancipation Bill.  I should not wonder.  But, in the meantime,\r\nI treasure up my lace very much.  I daren't even trust the washing of it\r\nto my maid\" (the little charity school-girl I have named before, but who\r\nsounded well as \"my maid\").  \"I always wash it myself.  And once it had\r\na narrow escape.  Of course, your ladyship knows that such lace must\r\nnever be starched or ironed.  Some people wash it in sugar and water,\r\nand some in coffee, to make it the right yellow colour; but I myself\r\nhave a very good receipt for washing it in milk, which stiffens it\r\nenough, and gives it a very good creamy colour.  Well, ma'am, I had\r\ntacked it together (and the beauty of this fine lace is that, when it is\r\nwet, it goes into a very little space), and put it to soak in milk,\r\nwhen, unfortunately, I left the room; on my return, I found pussy on the\r\ntable, looking very like a thief, but gulping very uncomfortably, as if\r\nshe was half-chocked with something she wanted to swallow and could not.\r\n And, would you believe it?  At first I pitied her, and said 'Poor\r\npussy! poor pussy!' till, all at once, I looked and saw the cup of milk\r\nempty-cleaned out!  'You naughty cat!' said I, and I believe I was\r\nprovoked enough to give her a slap, which did no good, but only helped\r\nthe lace down-just as one slaps a choking child on the back.  I could\r\nhave cried, I was so vexed; but I determined I would not give the lace\r\nup without a struggle for it.  I hoped the lace might disagree with her,\r\nat any rate; but it would have been too much for Job, if he had seen, as\r\nI did, that cat come in, quite placid and purring, not a quarter of an\r\nhour after, and almost expecting to be stroked.  'No, pussy!' said I,\r\n'if you have any conscience you ought not to expect that!'  And then a\r\nthought struck me; and I rang the bell for my maid, and sent her to Mr\r\nHoggins, with my compliments, and would he be kind enough to lend me one\r\nof his top-boots for an hour?  I did not think there was anything odd in\r\nthe message; but Jenny said the young men in the surgery laughed as if\r\nthey would be ill at my wanting a top-boot.  When it came, Jenny and I\r\nput pussy in, with her forefeet straight down, so that they were\r\nfastened, and could not scratch, and we gave her a teaspoonful of\r\ncurrent-jelly in which (your ladyship must excuse me) I had mixed some\r\ntartar emetic.  I shall never forget how anxious I was for the next\r\nhalf-hour.  I took pussy to my own room, and spread a clean towel on the\r\nfloor.  I could have kissed her when she returned the lace to sight,\r\nvery much as it had gone down.  Jenny had boiling water ready, and we\r\nsoaked it and soaked it, and spread it on a lavender-bush in the sun\r\nbefore I could touch it again, even to put it in milk.  But now your\r\nladyship would never guess that it had been in pussy's inside.\"",

    "We found out, in the course of the evening, that Lady Glenmire was going\r\nto pay Mrs Jamieson a long visit, as she had given up her apartments in\r\nEdinburgh, and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry.  On the\r\nwhole, we were rather glad to hear this, for she had made a pleasant\r\nimpression upon us; and it was also very comfortable to find, from\r\nthings which dropped out in the course of conversation, that, in\r\naddition to many other genteel qualities, she was far removed from the\r\n\"vulgarity of wealth.\"",
    "\"Don't you find it very unpleasant walking?\" asked Mrs Jamieson, as our\r\nrespective servants were announced.  It was a pretty regular question\r\nfrom Mrs Jamieson, who had her own carriage in the coach-house, and\r\nalways went out in a sedan-chair to the very shortest distances.  The\r\nanswers were nearly as much a matter of course.",
    "\"Oh dear, no! it is so pleasant and still at night!\"  \"Such a\r\nrefreshment after the excitement of a party!\"  \"The stars are so\r\nbeautiful!\"  This last was from Miss Matty.",
    "\"Are you fond of astronomy?\" Lady Glenmire asked.",
    "\"Not very,\" replied Miss Matty, rather confused at the moment to\r\nremember which was astronomy and which was astrology-but the answer was\r\ntrue under either circumstance, for she read, and was slightly alarmed\r\nat Francis Moore's astrological predictions; and, as to astronomy, in a\r\nprivate and confidential conversation, she had told me she never could\r\nbelieve that the earth was moving constantly, and that she would not\r\nbelieve it if she could, it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever\r\nshe thought about it.",
    "In our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night, so\r\nrefined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with \"my\r\nlady.\"",
    ".\r\nSIGNOR BRUNONI",
    "SOON after the events of which I gave an account in my last paper, I was\r\nsummoned home by my father's illness; and for a time I forgot, in\r\nanxiety about him, to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were\r\ngetting on, or how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness\r\nof the long visit which she was still paying to her sister-in-law, Mrs\r\nJamieson. When my father grew a little stronger I accompanied him to the\r\nseaside, so that altogether I seemed banished from Cranford, and was\r\ndeprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the\r\ndear little town for the greater part of that year.",
    "Late in November-when we had returned home again, and my father was once\r\nmore in good health-I received a letter from Miss Matty; and a very\r\nmysterious letter it was.  She began many sentences without ending them,\r\nrunning them one into another, in much the same confused sort of way in\r\nwhich written words run together on blotting-paper.  All I could make\r\nout was that, if my father was better (which she hoped he was), and\r\nwould take warning and wear a great-coat from Michaelmas to Lady-day, if\r\nturbans were in fashion, could I tell her?  Such a piece of gaiety was\r\ngoing to happen as had not been seen or known of since Wombwell's lions\r\ncame, when one of them ate a little child's arm; and she was, perhaps,\r\ntoo old to care about dress, but a new cap she must have; and, having\r\nheard that turbans were worn, and some of the county families likely to\r\ncome, she would like to look tidy, if I would bring her a cap from the\r\nmilliner I employed; and oh, dear! how careless of her to forget that\r\nshe wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit next Tuesday; when she\r\nhoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement, which she\r\nwould not now more particularly describe, only sea-green was her\r\nfavourite colour.  So she ended her letter; but in a P.S. she added, she\r\nthought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to\r\nCranford just now; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful\r\nmagic in the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in\r\nthe following week.",
    "I was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear Miss Matty,\r\nindependently of the conjuror, and most particularly anxious to prevent\r\nher from disfiguring her small, gentle, mousey face with a great\r\nSaracen's head turban; and accordingly, I bought her a pretty, neat,\r\nmiddle-aged cap, which, however, was rather a disappointment to her\r\nwhen, on my arrival, she followed me into my bedroom, ostensibly to poke\r\nthe fire, but in reality, I do believe, to see if the sea-green turban\r\nwas not inside the cap-box with which I had travelled.  It was in vain\r\nthat I twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and side fronts:\r\nher heart had been set upon a turban, and all she could do was to say,\r\nwith resignation in her look and voice-",
    "\"I am sure you did your best, my dear.  It is just like the caps all the\r\nladies in Cranford are wearing, and they have had theirs for a year, I\r\ndare say.  I should have liked something newer, I confess-something more\r\nlike the turbans Miss Betty Barker tells me Queen Adelaide wears; but it\r\nis very pretty, my dear.  And I dare say lavender will wear better than\r\nsea-green.  Well, after all, what is dress, that we should care anything\r\nabout it?  You'll tell me if you want anything, my dear.  Here is the\r\nbell.  I suppose turbans have not got down to Drumble yet?\"",
    "So saying, the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room,\r\nleaving me to dress for the evening, when, as she informed me, she\r\nexpected Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester, and she hoped I should not feel\r\nmyself too much tired to join the party.  Of course I should not; and I\r\nmade some haste to unpack and arrange my dress; but, with all my speed,\r\nI heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room\r\nbefore I was ready.  Just as I opened the door, I caught the words, \"I\r\nwas foolish to expect anything very genteel out of the Drumble shops;\r\npoor girl! she did her best, I've no doubt.\"  But, for all that, I had\r\nrather that she blamed Drumble and me than disfigured herself with a\r\nturban.",
    "Miss Pole was always the person, in the trio of Cranford ladies now\r\nassembled, to have had adventures.  She was in the habit of spending the\r\nmorning in rambling from shop to shop, not to purchase anything (except\r\nan occasional reel of cotton or a piece of tape), but to see the new\r\narticles and report upon them, and to collect all the stray pieces of\r\nintelligence in the town.  She had a way, too, of demurely popping\r\nhither and thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on\r\nany point-a way which, if she had not looked so very genteel and prim,\r\nmight have been considered impertinent.  And now, by the expressive way\r\nin which she cleared her throat, and waited for all minor subjects (such\r\nas caps and turbans) to be cleared off the course, we knew she had\r\nsomething very particular to relate, when the due pause came-and I defy\r\nany people possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long,\r\nwhere one among them sits up aloft in silence, looking down upon all the\r\nthings they chance to say as trivial and contemptible compared to what\r\nthey could disclose, if properly entreated.  Miss Pole began-",
    "\"As I was stepping out of Gordon's shop to-day, I chanced to go into the\r\n'George' (my Betty has a second-cousin who is chambermaid there, and I\r\nthought Betty would like to hear how she was), and, not seeing anyone\r\nabout, I strolled up the staircase, and found myself in the passage\r\nleading to the Assembly Room (you and I remember the Assembly Room, I am\r\nsure, Miss Matty! and the minuets de la cour!); so I went on, not\r\nthinking of what I was about, when, all at once, I perceived that I was\r\nin the middle of the preparations for to-morrow night-the room being\r\ndivided with great clothes-maids, over which Crosby's men were tacking\r\nred flannel; very dark and odd it seemed; it quite bewildered me, and I\r\nwas going on behind the screens, in my absence of mind, when a\r\ngentleman (quite the gentleman, I can assure you) stepped forwards and\r\nasked if I had any business he could arrange for me.  He spoke such\r\npretty broken English, I could not help thinking of Thaddeus of Warsaw,\r\nand the Hungarian Brothers, and Santo Sebastiani; and while I was busy\r\npicturing his past life to myself, he had bowed me out of the room.  But\r\nwait a minute!  You have not heard half my story yet!  I was going\r\ndownstairs, when who should I meet but Betty's second-cousin.  So, of\r\ncourse, I stopped to speak to her for Betty's sake; and she told me that\r\nI had really seen the conjuror-the gentleman who spoke broken English\r\nwas Signor Brunoni himself.  Just at this moment he passed us on the\r\nstairs, making such a graceful bow! in reply to which I dropped a\r\ncurtsey-all foreigners have such polite manners, one catches something\r\nof it.  But when he had gone downstairs, I bethought me that I had\r\ndropped my glove in the Assembly Room (it was safe in my muff all the\r\ntime, but I never found it till afterwards); so I went back, and, just\r\nas I was creeping up the passage left on one side of the great screen\r\nthat goes nearly across the room, who should I see but the very same\r\ngentleman that had met me before, and passed me on the stairs, coming\r\nnow forwards from the inner part of the room, to which there is no\r\nentrance-you remember, Miss Matty-and just repeating, in his pretty\r\nbroken English, the inquiry if I had any business there-I don't mean\r\nthat he put it quite so bluntly, but he seemed very determined that I\r\nshould not pass the screen-so, of course, I explained about my glove,\r\nwhich, curiously enough, I found at that very moment.\"",
    "Miss Pole, then, had seen the conjuror-the real, live conjuror! and\r\nnumerous were the questions we all asked her.  \"Had he a beard?\"  \"Was\r\nhe young, or old?\"  \"Fair, or dark?\"  \"Did he look\"-(unable to shape my\r\nquestion prudently, I put it in another form)-\"How did he look?\"  In\r\nshort, Miss Pole was the heroine of the evening, owing to her morning's\r\nencounter.  If she was not the rose (that is to say the conjuror) she\r\nhad been near it.",
    "Conjuration, sleight of hand, magic, witchcraft, were the subjects of\r\nthe evening.  Miss Pole was slightly sceptical, and inclined to think\r\nthere might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of\r\nthe Witch of Endor.  Mrs Forrester believed everything, from ghosts to\r\ndeath-watches.  Miss Matty ranged between the two-always convinced by\r\nthe last speaker.  I think she was naturally more inclined to Mrs\r\nForrester's side, but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to\r\nMiss Jenkyns kept her equally balanced-Miss Jenkyns, who would never\r\nallow a servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed\r\nthemselves round candles \"winding-sheets,\" but insisted on their being\r\nspoken of as \"roley-poleys!\"  A sister of hers to be superstitious!  It\r\nwould never do.",
    "After tea, I was despatched downstairs into the dining-parlour for that\r\nvolume of the old Encyclop\u00e6dia which contained the nouns beginning with\r\nC, in order that Miss Pole might prime herself with scientific\r\nexplanations for the tricks of the following evening.  It spoilt the\r\npool at Preference which Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester had been looking\r\nforward to, for Miss Pole became so much absorbed in her subject, and\r\nthe plates by which it was illustrated, that we felt it would be cruel\r\nto disturb her otherwise than by one or two well-timed yawns, which I\r\nthrew in now and then, for I was really touched by the meek way in which\r\nthe two ladies were bearing their disappointment.  But Miss Pole only\r\nread the more zealously, imparting to us no more information than this-",
    "\"Ah! I see; I comprehend perfectly.  A represents the ball.  Put A\r\nbetween B and D-no! between C and F, and turn the second joint of the\r\nthird finger of your left hand over the wrist of your right H.  Very\r\nclear indeed!  My dear Mrs Forrester, conjuring and witchcraft is a mere\r\naffair of the alphabet.  Do let me read you this one passage?\"",
    "Mrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her, saying, from a child\r\nupwards, she never could understand being read aloud to; and I dropped\r\nthe pack of cards, which I had been shuffling very audibly, and by this\r\ndiscreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to perceive that Preference was to\r\nhave been the order of the evening, and to propose, rather unwillingly,\r\nthat the pool should commence.  The pleasant brightness that stole over\r\nthe other two ladies' faces on this!  Miss Matty had one or two twinges\r\nof self-reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her studies: and\r\ndid not remember her cards well, or give her full attention to the game,\r\nuntil she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of\r\nthe Encyclop\u00e6dia to Miss Pole, who accepted it thankfully, and said\r\nBetty should take it home when she came with the lantern.",
    "The next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of\r\nthe gaiety before us.  Miss Matty went up to dress betimes, and hurried\r\nme until I was ready, when we found we had an hour-and-a-half to wait\r\nbefore the \"doors opened at seven precisely.\"  And we had only twenty\r\nyards to go!  However, as Miss Matty said, it would not do to get too\r\nmuch absorbed in anything, and forget the time; so she thought we had\r\nbetter sit quietly, without lighting the candles, till five minutes to\r\nseven.  So Miss Matty dozed, and I knitted.",
    "At length we set off; and at the door under the carriage-way at the\r\n\"George,\" we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole: the latter was discussing\r\nthe subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever, and throwing\r\nX's and B's at our heads like hailstones.  She had even copied one or\r\ntwo of the \"receipts\"-as she called them-for the different tricks, on\r\nbacks of letters, ready to explain and to detect Signor Brunoni's arts.",
    "We went into the cloak-room adjoining the Assembly Room; Miss Matty gave\r\na sigh or two to her departed youth, and the remembrance of the last\r\ntime she had been there, as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the\r\nstrange, quaint old mirror in the cloak-room.  The Assembly Room had\r\nbeen added to the inn, about a hundred years before, by the different\r\ncounty families, who met together there once a month during the winter\r\nto dance and play at cards.  Many a county beauty had first swung\r\nthrough the minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen Charlotte in\r\nthis very room.  It was said that one of the Gunnings had graced the\r\napartment with her beauty; it was certain that a rich and beautiful\r\nwidow, Lady Williams, had here been smitten with the noble figure of a\r\nyoung artist, who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for\r\nprofessional purposes, and accompanied his patrons to the Cranford\r\nAssembly.  And a pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome\r\nhusband, if all tales were true.  Now, no beauty blushed and dimpled\r\nalong the sides of the Cranford Assembly Room; no handsome artist won\r\nhearts by his bow, _chapeau bras_ in hand; the old room was dingy; the\r\nsalmon-coloured paint had faded into a drab; great pieces of plaster had\r\nchipped off from the fine wreaths and festoons on its walls; but still a\r\nmouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place, and a dusty\r\nrecollection of the days that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs\r\nForrester bridle up as they entered, and walk mincingly up the room, as\r\nif there were a number of genteel observers, instead of two little boys\r\nwith a stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time.",
    "We stopped short at the second front row; I could hardly understand why,\r\nuntil I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families\r\nwere expected; and when he shook his head, and believed not, Mrs\r\nForrester and Miss Matty moved forwards, and our party represented a\r\nconversational square.  The front row was soon augmented and enriched by\r\nLady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson.  We six occupied the two front rows, and\r\nour aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shopkeepers\r\nwho strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back\r\nbenches.  At least I conjectured so, from the noise they made, and the\r\nsonorous bumps they gave in sitting down; but when, in weariness of the\r\nobstinate green curtain that would not draw up, but would stare at me\r\nwith two odd eyes, seen through holes, as in the old tapestry story, I\r\nwould fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me,\r\nMiss Pole clutched my arm, and begged me not to turn, for \"it was not\r\nthe thing.\"  What \"the thing\" was, I never could find out, but it must\r\nhave been something eminently dull and tiresome.  However, we all sat\r\neyes right, square front, gazing at the tantalising curtain, and hardly\r\nspeaking intelligibly, we were so afraid of being caught in the\r\nvulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement.  Mrs\r\nJamieson was the most fortunate, for she fell asleep.",
    "At length the eyes disappeared-the curtain quivered-one side went up\r\nbefore the other, which stuck fast; it was dropped again, and, with a\r\nfresh effort, and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand, it flew up,\r\nrevealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume,\r\nseated before a little table, gazing at us (I should have said with the\r\nsame eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain) with\r\ncalm and condescending dignity, \"like a being of another sphere,\" as I\r\nheard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me.",
    "\"That's not Signor Brunoni!\" said Miss Pole decidedly; and so audibly\r\nthat I am sure he heard, for he glanced down over his flowing beard at\r\nour party with an air of mute reproach.  \"Signor Brunoni had no\r\nbeard-but perhaps he'll come soon.\"  So she lulled herself into\r\npatience. Meanwhile, Miss Matty had reconnoitred through her eye-glass,\r\nwiped it, and looked again.  Then she turned round, and said to me, in a\r\nkind, mild, sorrowful tone-",
    "\"You see, my dear, turbans _are_ worn.\"",
    "But we had no time for more conversation.  The Grand Turk, as Miss Pole\r\nchose to call him, arose and announced himself as Signor Brunoni.",
    "\"I don't believe him!\" exclaimed Miss Pole, in a defiant manner.  He\r\nlooked at her again, with the same dignified upbraiding in his\r\ncountenance.  \"I don't!\" she repeated more positively than ever.\r\n\"Signor Brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about his chin, but\r\nlooked like a close-shaved Christian gentleman.\"",
    "Miss Pole's energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up Mrs\r\nJamieson, who opened her eyes wide, in sign of the deepest attention-a\r\nproceeding which silenced Miss Pole and encouraged the Grand Turk to\r\nproceed, which he did in very broken English-so broken that there was no\r\ncohesion between the parts of his sentences; a fact which he himself\r\nperceived at last, and so left off speaking and proceeded to action.",
    "Now we _were_ astonished.  How he did his tricks I could not imagine;\r\nno, not even when Miss Pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began\r\nreading aloud-or at least in a very audible whisper-the separate\r\n\"receipts\" for the most common of his tricks.  If ever I saw a man frown\r\nand look enraged, I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole; but, as she\r\nsaid, what could be expected but unchristian looks from a Mussulman?  If\r\nMiss Pole were sceptical, and more engrossed with her receipts and\r\ndiagrams than with his tricks, Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were\r\nmystified and perplexed to the highest degree.  Mrs Jamieson kept taking\r\nher spectacles off and wiping them, as if she thought it was something\r\ndefective in them which made the legerdemain; and Lady Glenmire, who had\r\nseen many curious sights in Edinburgh, was very much struck with the\r\ntricks, and would not at all agree with Miss Pole, who declared that\r\nanybody could do them with a little practice, and that she would,\r\nherself, undertake to do all he did, with two hours given to study the\r\nEncyclop\u00e6dia and make her third finger flexible.",
    "At last Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester became perfectly awestricken.  They\r\nwhispered together.  I sat just behind them, so I could not help hearing\r\nwhat they were saying.  Miss Matty asked Mrs Forrester \"if she thought\r\nit was quite right to have come to see such things?  She could not help\r\nfearing they were lending encouragement to something that was not\r\nquite\"- A little shake of the head filled up the blank.  Mrs Forrester\r\nreplied, that the same thought had crossed her mind; she too was feeling\r\nvery uncomfortable, it was so very strange.  She was quite certain that\r\nit was her pocket-handkerchief which was in that loaf just now; and it\r\nhad been in her own hand not five minutes before.  She wondered who had\r\nfurnished the bread?  She was sure it could not be Dakin, because he was\r\nthe churchwarden.  Suddenly Miss Matty half-turned towards me-",
    "\"Will you look, my dear-you are a stranger in the town, and it won't\r\ngive rise to unpleasant reports-will you just look round and see if the\r\nrector is here?  If he is, I think we may conclude that this wonderful\r\nman is sanctioned by the Church, and that will be a great relief to my\r\nmind.\"",
    "I looked, and I saw the tall, thin, dry, dusty rector, sitting\r\nsurrounded by National School boys, guarded by troops of his own sex\r\nfrom any approach of the many Cranford spinsters.  His kind face was all\r\nagape with broad smiles, and the boys around him were in chinks of\r\nlaughing.  I told Miss Matty that the Church was smiling approval, which\r\nset her mind at ease.",
    "[Picture: Afraid of matrimonial reports]",
    "I have never named Mr Hayter, the rector, because I, as a well-to-do and\r\nhappy young woman, never came in contact with him.  He was an old\r\nbachelor, but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him\r\nas any girl of eighteen: and he would rush into a shop or dive down an\r\nentry, sooner than encounter any of the Cranford ladies in the street;\r\nand, as for the Preference parties, I did not wonder at his not\r\naccepting invitations to them.  To tell the truth, I always suspected\r\nMiss Pole of having given very vigorous chase to Mr Hayter when he first\r\ncame to Cranford; and not the less, because now she appeared to share so\r\nvividly in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his.  He\r\nfound all his interests among the poor and helpless; he had treated the\r\nNational School boys this very night to the performance; and virtue was\r\nfor once its own reward, for they guarded him right and left, and clung\r\nround him as if he had been the queen-bee and they the swarm.  He felt\r\nso safe in their environment that he could even afford to give our party\r\na bow as we filed out.  Miss Pole ignored his presence, and pretended to\r\nbe absorbed in convincing us that we had been cheated, and had not seen\r\nSignor Brunoni after all.",
    ".\r\nTHE PANIC",
    "I THINK a series of circumstances dated from Signor Brunoni's visit to\r\nCranford, which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him,\r\nthough I don't know that he had anything really to do with them.  All at\r\nonce all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town.  There\r\nwere one or two robberies-real _bon\u00e2 fide_ robberies; men had up before\r\nthe magistrates and committed for trial-and that seemed to make us all\r\nafraid of being robbed; and for a long time, at Miss Matty's, I know, we\r\nused to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars\r\nevery night, Miss Matty leading the way, armed with the poker, I\r\nfollowing with the hearth-brush, and Martha carrying the shovel and\r\nfire-irons with which to sound the alarm; and by the accidental hitting\r\ntogether of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted\r\nourselves up, all three together, in the back-kitchen, or store-room, or\r\nwherever we happened to be, till, when our affright was over, we\r\nrecollected ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance.  By day\r\nwe heard strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers, of carts\r\nthat went about in the dead of night, drawn by horses shod with felt,\r\nand guarded by men in dark clothes, going round the town, no doubt in\r\nsearch of some unwatched house or some unfastened door.",
    "Miss Pole, who affected great bravery herself, was the principal person\r\nto collect and arrange these reports so as to make them assume their\r\nmost fearful aspect.  But we discovered that she had begged one of Mr\r\nHoggins's worn-out hats to hang up in her lobby, and we (at least I) had\r\ndoubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of\r\nhaving her house broken into, as she protested she should.  Miss Matty\r\nmade no secret of being an arrant coward, but she went regularly through\r\nher housekeeper's duty of inspection-only the hour for this became\r\nearlier and earlier, till at last we went the rounds at half-past six,\r\nand Miss Matty adjourned to bed soon after seven, \"in order to get the\r\nnight over the sooner.\"",
    "Cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town\r\nthat it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and well-bred to be\r\notherwise, and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly.\r\nBut we comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each\r\nother that the robberies could never have been committed by any Cranford\r\nperson; it must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this\r\ndisgrace upon the town, and occasioned as many precautions as if we were\r\nliving among the Red Indians or the French.",
    "This last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification\r\nwas made by Mrs Forrester, whose father had served under General\r\nBurgoyne in the American war, and whose husband had fought the French in\r\nSpain. She indeed inclined to the idea that, in some way, the French\r\nwere connected with the small thefts, which were ascertained facts, and\r\nthe burglaries and highway robberies, which were rumours.  She had been\r\ndeeply impressed with the idea of French spies at some time in her life;\r\nand the notion could never be fairly eradicated, but sprang up again\r\nfrom time to time.  And now her theory was this:-The Cranford people\r\nrespected themselves too much, and were too grateful to the aristocracy\r\nwho were so kind as to live near the town, ever to disgrace their\r\nbringing up by being dishonest or immoral; therefore, we must believe\r\nthat the robbers were strangers-if strangers, why not foreigners?-if\r\nforeigners, who so likely as the French?  Signor Brunoni spoke broken\r\nEnglish like a Frenchman; and, though he wore a turban like a Turk, Mrs\r\nForrester had seen a print of Madame de Sta\u00ebl with a turban on, and\r\nanother of Mr Denon in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror\r\nhad made his appearance, showing clearly that the French, as well as the\r\nTurks, wore turbans.  There could be no doubt Signor Brunoni was a\r\nFrenchman-a French spy come to discover the weak and undefended places\r\nof England, and doubtless he had his accomplices.  For her part, she,\r\nMrs Forrester, had always had her own opinion of Miss Pole's adventure\r\nat the \"George Inn\"-seeing two men where only one was believed to be.\r\nFrench people had ways and means which, she was thankful to say, the\r\nEnglish knew nothing about; and she had never felt quite easy in her\r\nmind about going to see that conjuror-it was rather too much like a\r\nforbidden thing, though the rector was there.  In short, Mrs Forrester\r\ngrew more excited than we had ever known her before, and, being an\r\nofficer's daughter and widow, we looked up to her opinion, of course.",
    "Really I do not know how much was true or false in the reports which\r\nflew about like wildfire just at this time; but it seemed to me then\r\nthat there was every reason to believe that at Mardon (a small town\r\nabout eight miles from Cranford) houses and shops were entered by holes\r\nmade in the walls, the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of\r\nthe night, and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or\r\nout of the house.  Miss Matty gave it up in despair when she heard of\r\nthis. \"What was the use,\" said she, \"of locks and bolts, and bells to\r\nthe windows, and going round the house every night?  That last trick was\r\nfit for a conjuror.  Now she did believe that Signor Brunoni was at the\r\nbottom of it.\"",
    "One afternoon, about five o'clock, we were startled by a hasty knock at\r\nthe door.  Miss Matty bade me run and tell Martha on no account to open\r\nthe door till she (Miss Matty) had reconnoitred through the window; and\r\nshe armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the\r\nvisitor, in case he should show a face covered with black crape, as he\r\nlooked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there.  But it was nobody\r\nbut Miss Pole and Betty.  The former came upstairs, carrying a little\r\nhand-basket, and she was evidently in a state of great agitation.",
    "\"Take care of that!\" said she to me, as I offered to relieve her of her\r\nbasket.  \"It's my plate.  I am sure there is a plan to rob my house\r\nto-night.  I am come to throw myself on your hospitality, Miss Matty.\r\nBetty is going to sleep with her cousin at the 'George.'  I can sit up\r\nhere all night if you will allow me; but my house is so far from any\r\nneighbours, and I don't believe we could be heard if we screamed ever\r\nso!\"",
    "\"But,\" said Miss Matty, \"what has alarmed you so much?  Have you seen\r\nany men lurking about the house?\"",
    "\"Oh, yes!\" answered Miss Pole.  \"Two very bad-looking men have gone\r\nthree times past the house, very slowly; and an Irish beggar-woman came\r\nnot half-an-hour ago, and all but forced herself in past Betty, saying\r\nher children were starving, and she must speak to the mistress.  You\r\nsee, she said 'mistress,' though there was a hat hanging up in the hall,\r\nand it would have been more natural to have said 'master.'  But Betty\r\nshut the door in her face, and came up to me, and we got the spoons\r\ntogether, and sat in the parlour-window watching till we saw Thomas\r\nJones going from his work, when we called to him and asked him to take\r\ncare of us into the town.\"",
    "We might have triumphed over Miss Pole, who had professed such bravery\r\nuntil she was frightened; but we were too glad to perceive that she\r\nshared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her; and I gave up my\r\nroom to her very willingly, and shared Miss Matty's bed for the night.\r\nBut before we retired, the two ladies rummaged up, out of the recesses\r\nof their memory, such horrid stories of robbery and murder that I quite\r\nquaked in my shoes.  Miss Pole was evidently anxious to prove that such\r\nterrible events had occurred within her experience that she was\r\njustified in her sudden panic; and Miss Matty did not like to be\r\noutdone, and capped every story with one yet more horrible, till it\r\nreminded me oddly enough, of an old story I had read somewhere, of a\r\nnightingale and a musician, who strove one against the other which could\r\nproduce the most admirable music, till poor Philomel dropped down dead.",
    "One of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a\r\ngirl who was left in charge of a great house in Cumberland on some\r\nparticular fair-day, when the other servants all went off to the\r\ngaieties.  The family were away in London, and a pedlar came by, and\r\nasked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen, saying he would\r\ncall for it again at night; and the girl (a gamekeeper's daughter),\r\nroaming about in search of amusement, chanced to hit upon a gun hanging\r\nup in the hall, and took it down to look at the chasing; and it went off\r\nthrough the open kitchen door, hit the pack, and a slow dark thread of\r\nblood came oozing out. (How Miss Pole enjoyed this part of the story,\r\ndwelling on each word as if she loved it!)  She rather hurried over the\r\nfurther account of the girl's bravery, and I have but a confused idea\r\nthat, somehow, she baffled the robbers with Italian irons, heated\r\nred-hot, and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease.",
    "We parted for the night with an awe-stricken wonder as to what we should\r\nhear of in the morning-and, on my part, with a vehement desire for the\r\nnight to be over and gone: I was so afraid lest the robbers should have\r\nseen, from some dark lurking-place, that Miss Pole had carried off her\r\nplate, and thus have a double motive for attacking our house.",
    "[Picture: Asked him to take care of us]",
    "But until Lady Glenmire came to call next day we heard of nothing\r\nunusual.  The kitchen fire-irons were in exactly the same position\r\nagainst the back door as when Martha and I had skilfully piled them up,\r\nlike spillikins, ready to fall with an awful clatter if only a cat had\r\ntouched the outside panels.  I had wondered what we should all do if\r\nthus awakened and alarmed, and had proposed to Miss Matty that we should\r\ncover up our faces under the bed-clothes so that there should be no\r\ndanger of the robbers thinking that we could identify them; but Miss\r\nMatty, who was trembling very much, scouted this idea, and said we owed\r\nit to society to apprehend them, and that she should certainly do her\r\nbest to lay hold of them and lock them up in the garret till morning.",
    "When Lady Glenmire came, we almost felt jealous of her.  Mrs Jamieson's\r\nhouse had really been attacked; at least there were men's footsteps to\r\nbe seen on the flower borders, underneath the kitchen windows, \"where\r\nnae men should be;\" and Carlo had barked all through the night as if\r\nstrangers were abroad.  Mrs Jamieson had been awakened by Lady Glenmire,\r\nand they had rung the bell which communicated with Mr Mulliner's room in\r\nthe third storey, and when his night-capped head had appeared over the\r\nbannisters, in answer to the summons, they had told him of their alarm,\r\nand the reasons for it; whereupon he retreated into his bedroom, and\r\nlocked the door (for fear of draughts, as he informed them in the\r\nmorning), and opened the window, and called out valiantly to say, if the\r\nsupposed robbers would come to him he would fight them; but, as Lady\r\nGlenmire observed, that was but poor comfort, since they would have to\r\npass by Mrs Jamieson's room and her own before they could reach him, and\r\nmust be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the\r\nopportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower storeys, to go\r\nup to a garret, and there force a door in order to get at the champion\r\nof the house.  Lady Glenmire, after waiting and listening for some time\r\nin the drawing-room, had proposed to Mrs Jamieson that they should go to\r\nbed; but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat\r\nup and watched; and, accordingly, she packed herself warmly up on the\r\nsofa, where she was found by the housemaid, when she came into the room\r\nat six o'clock, fast asleep; but Lady Glenmire went to bed, and kept\r\nawake all night.",
    "When Miss Pole heard of this, she nodded her head in great satisfaction.\r\nShe had been sure we should hear of something happening in Cranford that\r\nnight; and we had heard.  It was clear enough they had first proposed to\r\nattack her house; but when they saw that she and Betty were on their\r\nguard, and had carried off the plate, they had changed their tactics and\r\ngone to Mrs Jamieson's, and no one knew what might have happened if\r\nCarlo had not barked, like a good dog as he was!",
    "Poor Carlo! his barking days were nearly over.  Whether the gang who\r\ninfested the neighbourhood were afraid of him, or whether they were\r\nrevengeful enough, for the way in which he had baffled them on the night\r\nin question, to poison him; or whether, as some among the more\r\nuneducated people thought, he died of apoplexy, brought on by too much\r\nfeeding and too little exercise; at any rate, it is certain that, two\r\ndays after this eventful night, Carlo was found dead, with his poor legs\r\nstretched out stiff in the attitude of running, as if by such unusual\r\nexertion he could escape the sure pursuer, Death.",
    "We were all sorry for Carlo, the old familiar friend who had snapped at\r\nus for so many years; and the mysterious mode of his death made us very\r\nuncomfortable.  Could Signor Brunoni be at the bottom of this?  He had\r\napparently killed a canary with only a word of command; his will seemed\r\nof deadly force; who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the\r\nneighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things!",
    "We whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings; but in the\r\nmornings our courage came back with the daylight, and in a week's time\r\nwe had got over the shock of Carlo's death; all but Mrs Jamieson.  She,\r\npoor thing, felt it as she had felt no event since her husband's death;\r\nindeed, Miss Pole said, that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good\r\ndeal, and occasioned her much uneasiness, it was possible that Carlo's\r\ndeath might be the greater affliction.  But there was always a tinge of\r\ncynicism in Miss Pole's remarks.  However, one thing was clear and\r\ncertain-it was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene;\r\nand Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point, shaking his head\r\nwhenever we inquired after his mistress, and speaking of her loss of\r\nappetite and bad nights very ominously; and with justice too, for if she\r\nhad two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a\r\nfacility of eating and sleeping.  If she could neither eat nor sleep,\r\nshe must be indeed out of spirits and out of health.",
    "Lady Glenmire (who had evidently taken very kindly to Cranford) did not\r\nlike the idea of Mrs Jamieson's going to Cheltenham, and more than once\r\ninsinuated pretty plainly that it was Mr Mulliner's doing, who had been\r\nmuch alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked, and since had\r\nsaid, more than once, that he felt it a very responsible charge to have\r\nto defend so many women.  Be that as it might, Mrs Jamieson went to\r\nCheltenham, escorted by Mr Mulliner; and Lady Glenmire remained in\r\npossession of the house, her ostensible office being to take care that\r\nthe maid-servants did not pick up followers.  She made a very\r\npleasant-looking dragon; and, as soon as it was arranged for her stay in\r\nCranford, she found out that Mrs Jamieson's visit to Cheltenham was just\r\nthe best thing in the world.  She had let her house in Edinburgh, and\r\nwas for the time house-less, so the charge of her sister-in-law's\r\ncomfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable.",
    "Miss Pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine, because\r\nof the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one\r\nwoman, whom she entitled \"that murderous gang.\"  She described their\r\nappearance in glowing colours, and I noticed that every time she went\r\nover the story some fresh trait of villainy was added to their\r\nappearance.  One was tall-he grew to be gigantic in height before we had\r\ndone with him; he of course had black hair-and by-and-by it hung in\r\nelf-locks over his forehead and down his back.  The other was short and\r\nbroad-and a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last\r\nof him; he had red hair-which deepened into carroty; and she was almost\r\nsure he had a cast in the eye-a decided squint.  As for the woman, her\r\neyes glared, and she was masculine-looking-a perfect virago; most\r\nprobably a man dressed in woman's clothes; afterwards, we heard of a\r\nbeard on her chin, and a manly voice and a stride.",
    "If Miss Pole was delighted to recount the events of that afternoon to\r\nall inquirers, others were not so proud of their adventures in the\r\nrobbery line.  Mr Hoggins, the surgeon, had been attacked at his own\r\ndoor by two ruffians, who were concealed in the shadow of the porch, and\r\nso effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between\r\nringing his bell and the servant's answering it.  Miss Pole was sure it\r\nwould turn out that this robbery had been committed by \"her men,\" and\r\nwent the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined, and\r\nto question Mr Hoggins.  She came to us afterwards; so we heard what she\r\nhad heard, straight and direct from the source, while we were yet in the\r\nexcitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first\r\nintelligence; for the event had only occurred the night before.",
    "\"Well!\" said Miss Pole, sitting down with the decision of a person who\r\nhas made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world (and such\r\npeople never tread lightly, or seat themselves without a bump), \"well,\r\nMiss Matty! men will be men.  Every mother's son of them wishes to be\r\nconsidered Samson and Solomon rolled into one-too strong ever to be\r\nbeaten or discomfited-too wise ever to be outwitted.  If you will\r\nnotice, they have always foreseen events, though they never tell one for\r\none's warning before the events happen.  My father was a man, and I know\r\nthe sex pretty well.\"",
    "She had talked herself out of breath, and we should have been very glad\r\nto fill up the necessary pause as chorus, but we did not exactly know\r\nwhat to say, or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex;\r\nso we only joined in generally, with a grave shake of the head, and a\r\nsoft murmur of \"They are very incomprehensible, certainly!\"",
    "\"Now, only think,\" said she.  \"There, I have undergone the risk of\r\nhaving one of my remaining teeth drawn (for one is terribly at the mercy\r\nof any surgeon-dentist; and I, for one, always speak them fair till I\r\nhave got my mouth out of their clutches), and, after all, Mr Hoggins is\r\ntoo much of a man to own that he was robbed last night.\"",
    "\"Not robbed!\" exclaimed the chorus.",
    "\"Don't tell me!\" Miss Pole exclaimed, angry that we could be for a\r\nmoment imposed upon.  \"I believe he was robbed, just as Betty told me,\r\nand he is ashamed to own it; and, to be sure, it was very silly of him\r\nto be robbed just at his own door; I daresay he feels that such a thing\r\nwon't raise him in the eyes of Cranford society, and is anxious to\r\nconceal it-but he need not have tried to impose upon me, by saying I\r\nmust have heard an exaggerated account of some petty theft of a neck of\r\nmutton, which, it seems, was stolen out of the safe in his yard last\r\nweek; he had the impertinence to add, he believed that that was taken by\r\nthe cat.  I have no doubt, if I could get at the bottom of it, it was\r\nthat Irishman dressed up in woman's clothes, who came spying about my\r\nhouse, with the story about the starving children.\"",
    "After we had duly condemned the want of candour which Mr Hoggins had\r\nevinced, and abused men in general, taking him for the representative\r\nand type, we got round to the subject about which we had been talking\r\nwhen Miss Pole came in; namely, how far, in the present disturbed state\r\nof the country, we could venture to accept an invitation which Miss\r\nMatty had just received from Mrs Forrester, to come as usual and keep\r\nthe anniversary of her wedding-day by drinking tea with her at five\r\no'clock, and playing a quiet pool afterwards.  Mrs Forrester had said\r\nthat she asked us with some diffidence, because the roads were, she\r\nfeared, very unsafe.  But she suggested that perhaps one of us would not\r\nobject to take the sedan, and that the others, by walking briskly, might\r\nkeep up with the long trot of the chairmen, and so we might all arrive\r\nsafely at Over Place, a suburb of the town.  (No; that is too large an\r\nexpression: a small cluster of houses separated from Cranford by about\r\ntwo hundred yards of a dark and lonely lane.)  There was no doubt but\r\nthat a similar note was awaiting Miss Pole at home; so her call was a\r\nvery fortunate affair, as it enabled us to consult together.  We would\r\nall much rather have declined this invitation; but we felt that it would\r\nnot be quite kind to Mrs Forrester, who would otherwise be left to a\r\nsolitary retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life.  Miss Matty\r\nand Miss Pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years, and now\r\nthey gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast, and to go\r\nthrough Darkness Lane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend.",
    "But when the evening came, Miss Matty (for it was she who was voted into\r\nthe chair, as she had a cold), before being shut down in the sedan, like\r\njack-in-a-box, implored the chairmen, whatever might befall, not to run\r\naway and leave her fastened up there, to be murdered; and even after\r\nthey had promised, I saw her tighten her features into the stern\r\ndetermination of a martyr, and she gave me a melancholy and ominous\r\nshake of the head through the glass.  However, we got there safely, only\r\nrather out of breath, for it was who could trot hardest through Darkness\r\nLane, and I am afraid poor Miss Matty was sadly jolted.",
    "Mrs Forrester had made extra preparations, in acknowledgment of our\r\nexertion in coming to see her through such dangers.  The usual forms of\r\ngenteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone\r\nthrough; and harmony and Preference seemed likely to be the order of the\r\nevening, but for an interesting conversation that began I don't know\r\nhow, but which had relation, of course, to the robbers who infested the\r\nneighbourhood of Cranford.",
    "Having braved the dangers of Darkness Lane, and thus having a little\r\nstock of reputation for courage to fall back upon; and also, I daresay,\r\ndesirous of proving ourselves superior to men (_videlicet_ Mr Hoggins)\r\nin the article of candour, we began to relate our individual fears, and\r\nthe private precautions we each of us took.  I owned that my pet\r\napprehension was eyes-eyes looking at me, and watching me, glittering\r\nout from some dull, flat, wooden surface; and that if I dared to go up\r\nto my looking-glass when I was panic-stricken, I should certainly turn\r\nit round, with its back towards me, for fear of seeing eyes behind me\r\nlooking out of the darkness.  I saw Miss Matty nerving herself up for a\r\nconfession; and at last out it came.  She owned that, ever since she had\r\nbeen a girl, she had dreaded being caught by her last leg, just as she\r\nwas getting into bed, by some one concealed under it.  She said, when\r\nshe was younger and more active, she used to take a flying leap from a\r\ndistance, and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once; but\r\nthat this had always annoyed Deborah, who piqued herself upon getting\r\ninto bed gracefully, and she had given it up in consequence.  But now\r\nthe old terror would often come over her, especially since Miss Pole's\r\nhouse had been attacked (we had got quite to believe in the fact of the\r\nattack having taken place), and yet it was very unpleasant to think of\r\nlooking under a bed, and seeing a man concealed, with a great, fierce\r\nface staring out at you; so she had bethought herself of\r\nsomething-perhaps I had noticed that she had told Martha to buy her a\r\npenny ball, such as children play with-and now she rolled this ball\r\nunder the bed every night: if it came out on the other side, well and\r\ngood; if not she always took care to have her hand on the bell-rope, and\r\nmeant to call out John and Harry, just as if she expected men-servants\r\nto answer her ring.",
    "We all applauded this ingenious contrivance, and Miss Matty sank back\r\ninto satisfied silence, with a look at Mrs Forrester as if to ask for\r\n_her_ private weakness.",
    "Mrs Forrester looked askance at Miss Pole, and tried to change the\r\nsubject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of\r\nthe neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of\r\ncoals at Christmas, and his supper every evening, for the loan of him at\r\nnights.  She had instructed him in his possible duties when he first\r\ncame; and, finding him sensible, she had given him the Major's sword\r\n(the Major was her late husband), and desired him to put it very\r\ncarefully behind his pillow at night, turning the edge towards the head\r\nof the pillow.  He was a sharp lad, she was sure; for, spying out the\r\nMajor's cocked hat, he had said, if he might have that to wear, he was\r\nsure he could frighten two Englishmen, or four Frenchmen any day.  But\r\nshe had impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting\r\non hats or anything else; but, if he heard any noise, he was to run at\r\nit with his drawn sword.  On my suggesting that some accident might\r\noccur from such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions, and that he\r\nmight rush on Jenny getting up to wash, and have spitted her before he\r\nhad discovered that she was not a Frenchman, Mrs Forrester said she did\r\nnot think that that was likely, for he was a very sound sleeper, and\r\ngenerally had to be well shaken or cold-pigged in a morning before they\r\ncould rouse him.  She sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to\r\nthe hearty suppers the poor lad ate, for he was half-starved at home,\r\nand she told Jenny to see that he got a good meal at night.",
    "[Picture: Slaughterous and indiscriminate directions]",
    "Still this was no confession of Mrs Forrester's peculiar timidity, and\r\nwe urged her to tell us what she thought would frighten her more than\r\nanything.  She paused, and stirred the fire, and snuffed the candles,\r\nand then she said, in a sounding whisper-",
    "\"Ghosts!\"",
    "She looked at Miss Pole, as much as to say, she had declared it, and\r\nwould stand by it.  Such a look was a challenge in itself.  Miss Pole\r\ncame down upon her with indigestion, spectral illusions, optical\r\ndelusions, and a great deal out of Dr Ferrier and Dr Hibbert besides.\r\nMiss Matty had rather a leaning to ghosts, as I have mentioned before,\r\nand what little she did say was all on Mrs Forrester's side, who,\r\nemboldened by sympathy, protested that ghosts were a part of her\r\nreligion; that surely she, the widow of a major in the army, knew what\r\nto be frightened at, and what not; in short, I never saw Mrs Forrester\r\nso warm either before or since, for she was a gentle, meek, enduring old\r\nlady in most things.  Not all the elder-wine that ever was mulled could\r\nthis night wash out the remembrance of this difference between Miss Pole\r\nand her hostess.  Indeed, when the elder-wine was brought in, it gave\r\nrise to a new burst of discussion; for Jenny, the little maiden who\r\nstaggered under the tray, had to give evidence of having seen a ghost\r\nwith her own eyes, not so many nights ago, in Darkness Lane, the very\r\nlane we were to go through on our way home.",
    "In spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last consideration gave\r\nme, I could not help being amused at Jenny's position, which was\r\nexceedingly like that of a witness being examined and cross-examined by\r\ntwo counsel who are not at all scrupulous about asking leading\r\nquestions. The conclusion I arrived at was, that Jenny had certainly\r\nseen something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused.  A\r\nlady all in white, and without her head, was what she deposed and\r\nadhered to, supported by a consciousness of the secret sympathy of her\r\nmistress under the withering scorn with which Miss Pole regarded her.\r\nAnd not only she, but many others, had seen this headless lady, who sat\r\nby the roadside wringing her hands as in deep grief.  Mrs Forrester\r\nlooked at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph; but\r\nthen she had not to pass through Darkness Lane before she could bury\r\nherself beneath her own familiar bed-clothes.",
    "We preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were\r\nputting on our things to go home, for there was no knowing how near the\r\nghostly head and ears might be, or what spiritual connection they might\r\nbe keeping up with the unhappy body in Darkness Lane; and, therefore,\r\neven Miss Pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such\r\nsubjects, for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk.  At\r\nleast, so I conjecture; for, instead of the busy clatter usual in the\r\noperation, we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral.  Miss\r\nMatty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out\r\ndisagreeable sights, and the men (either because they were in spirits\r\nthat their labours were so nearly ended, or because they were going down\r\nhill), set off at such a round and merry pace, that it was all Miss Pole\r\nand I could do to keep up with them.  She had breath for nothing beyond\r\nan imploring \"Don't leave me!\" uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly\r\nthat I could not have quitted her, ghost or no ghost.  What a relief it\r\nwas when the men, weary of their burden and their quick trot, stopped\r\njust where Headingley Causeway branches off from Darkness Lane!  Miss\r\nPole unloosed me and caught at one of the men-",
    "\"Could not you-could not you take Miss Matty round by Headingley\r\nCauseway?-the pavement in Darkness Lane jolts so, and she is not very\r\nstrong.\"",
    "A smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair-",
    "\"Oh! pray go on!  What is the matter?  What is the matter?  I will give\r\nyou sixpence more to go on very fast; pray don't stop here.\"",
    "\"And I'll give you a shilling,\" said Miss Pole, with tremulous dignity,\r\n\"if you'll go by Headingley Causeway.\"",
    "The two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair, and went along\r\nthe causeway, which certainly answered Miss Pole's kind purpose of\r\nsaving Miss Matty's bones; for it was covered with soft, thick mud, and\r\neven a fall there would have been easy till the getting-up came, when\r\nthere might have been some difficulty in extrication.",

    "THE next morning I met Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole setting out on a long\r\nwalk to find some old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her\r\nskill in knitting woollen stockings.  Miss Pole said to me, with a smile\r\nhalf-kindly and half-contemptuous upon her countenance, \"I have been\r\njust telling Lady Glenmire of our poor friend Mrs Forrester, and her\r\nterror of ghosts.  It comes from living so much alone, and listening to\r\nthe bug-a-boo stories of that Jenny of hers.\"  She was so calm and so\r\nmuch above superstitious fears herself that I was almost ashamed to say\r\nhow glad I had been of her Headingley Causeway proposition the night\r\nbefore, and turned off the conversation to something else.",
    "In the afternoon Miss Pole called on Miss Matty to tell her of the\r\nadventure-the real adventure they had met with on their morning's walk.\r\nThey had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take\r\nacross the fields in order to find the knitting old woman, and had\r\nstopped to inquire at a little wayside public-house, standing on the\r\nhigh road to London, about three miles from Cranford.  The good woman\r\nhad asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her\r\nhusband, who could direct them better than she could; and, while they\r\nwere sitting in the sanded parlour, a little girl came in.  They thought\r\nthat she belonged to the landlady, and began some trifling conversation\r\nwith her; but, on Mrs Roberts's return, she told them that the little\r\nthing was the only child of a couple who were staying in the house.  And\r\nthen she began a long story, out of which Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole\r\ncould only gather one or two decided facts, which were that, about six\r\nweeks ago, a light spring-cart had broken down just before their door,\r\nin which there were two men, one woman, and this child.  One of the men\r\nwas seriously hurt-no bones broken, only \"shaken,\" the landlady called\r\nit; but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury, for he\r\nhad languished in their house ever since, attended by his wife, the\r\nmother of this little girl. Miss Pole had asked what he was, what he\r\nlooked like.  And Mrs Roberts had made answer that he was not like a\r\ngentleman, nor yet like a common person; if it had not been that he and\r\nhis wife were such decent, quiet people, she could almost have thought\r\nhe was a mountebank, or something of that kind, for they had a great box\r\nin the cart, full of she did not know what.  She had helped to unpack\r\nit, and take out their linen and clothes, when the other man-his\r\ntwin-brother, she believed he was-had gone off with the horse and cart.",
    "Miss Pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point, and expressed\r\nher idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and\r\nall should have disappeared; but good Mrs Roberts seemed to have become\r\nquite indignant at Miss Pole's implied suggestion; in fact, Miss Pole\r\nsaid she was as angry as if Miss Pole had told her that she herself was\r\na swindler.  As the best way of convincing the ladies, she bethought her\r\nof begging them to see the wife; and, as Miss Pole said, there was no\r\ndoubting the honest, worn, bronzed face of the woman, who at the first\r\ntender word from Lady Glenmire, burst into tears, which she was too weak\r\nto check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her\r\nsobs, in order that she might testify to the Christian kindness shown by\r\nMr and Mrs Roberts.  Miss Pole came round with a swing to as vehement a\r\nbelief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before; and, as\r\na proof of this, her energy in the poor sufferer's behalf was nothing\r\ndaunted when she found out that he, and no other, was our Signor\r\nBrunoni, to whom all Cranford had been attributing all manner of evil\r\nthis six weeks past!  Yes! his wife said his proper name was Samuel\r\nBrown-\"Sam,\" she called him-but to the last we preferred calling him\r\n\"the Signor\"; it sounded so much better.",
    "The end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was that it was\r\nagreed that he should be placed under medical advice, and for any\r\nexpense incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire promised to hold\r\nherself responsible, and had accordingly gone to Mr Hoggins to beg him\r\nto ride over to the \"Rising Sun\" that very afternoon, and examine into\r\nthe signor's real state; and, as Miss Pole said, if it was desirable to\r\nremove him to Cranford to be more immediately under Mr Hoggins's eye,\r\nshe would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent.  Mrs\r\nRoberts had been as kind as could be all throughout, but it was evident\r\nthat their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience.",
    "Before Miss Pole left us, Miss Matty and I were as full of the morning's\r\nadventure as she was.  We talked about it all the evening, turning it in\r\nevery possible light, and we went to bed anxious for the morning, when\r\nwe should surely hear from someone what Mr Hoggins thought and\r\nrecommended; for, as Miss Matty observed, though Mr Hoggins did say\r\n\"Jack's up,\" \"a fig for his heels,\" and called Preference \"Pref.\" she\r\nbelieved he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon.  Indeed, we\r\nwere rather proud of our doctor at Cranford, as a doctor.  We often\r\nwished, when we heard of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being\r\nill, that they would send for Mr Hoggins; but, on consideration, we were\r\nrather glad they did not, for, if we were ailing, what should we do if\r\nMr Hoggins had been appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Family?\r\n As a surgeon we were proud of him; but as a man-or rather, I should\r\nsay, as a gentleman-we could only shake our heads over his name and\r\nhimself, and wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield's Letters in the\r\ndays when his manners were susceptible of improvement.  Nevertheless, we\r\nall regarded his dictum in the signor's case as infallible, and when he\r\nsaid that with care and attention he might rally, we had no more fear\r\nfor him.",
    "But, although we had no more fear, everybody did as much as if there was\r\ngreat cause for anxiety-as indeed there was until Mr Hoggins took charge\r\nof him.  Miss Pole looked out clean and comfortable, if homely,\r\nlodgings; Miss Matty sent the sedan-chair for him, and Martha and I\r\naired it well before it left Cranford by holding a warming-pan full of\r\nred-hot coals in it, and then shutting it up close, smoke and all, until\r\nthe time when he should get into it at the \"Rising Sun.\"  Lady Glenmire\r\nundertook the medical department under Mr Hoggins's directions, and\r\nrummaged up all Mrs Jamieson's medicine glasses, and spoons, and\r\nbed-tables, in a free-and-easy way, that made Miss Matty feel a little\r\nanxious as to what that lady and Mr Mulliner might say, if they knew.\r\nMrs Forrester made some of the bread-jelly, for which she was so famous,\r\nto have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive.  A\r\npresent of this bread-jelly was the highest mark of favour dear Mrs\r\nForrester could confer.  Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt,\r\nbut she had met with a very decided rebuff; that lady told her that she\r\ncould not part with it to any one during her life, and that after her\r\ndeath it was bequeathed, as her executors would find, to Miss Matty.\r\nWhat Miss Matty, or, as Mrs Forrester called her (remembering the clause\r\nin her will and the dignity of the occasion), Miss Matilda Jenkyns-might\r\nchoose to do with the receipt when it came into her possession-whether\r\nto make it public, or to hand it down as an heirloom-she did not know,\r\nnor would she dictate.  And a mould of this admirable, digestible,\r\nunique bread-jelly was sent by Mrs Forrester to our poor sick conjuror.\r\nWho says that the aristocracy are proud?  Here was a lady by birth a\r\nTyrrell, and descended from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus,\r\nand in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes\r\nin the Tower, going every day to see what dainty dishes she could\r\nprepare for Samuel Brown, a mountebank!  But, indeed, it was wonderful\r\nto see what kind feelings were called out by this poor man's coming\r\namongst us.  And also wonderful to see how the great Cranford panic,\r\nwhich had been occasioned by his first coming in his Turkish dress,\r\nmelted away into thin air on his second coming-pale and feeble, and with\r\nhis heavy, filmy eyes, that only brightened a very little when they fell\r\nupon the countenance of his faithful wife, or their pale and sorrowful\r\nlittle girl.",
    "Somehow we all forgot to be afraid.  I daresay it was that finding out\r\nthat he, who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his\r\nunprecedented arts, had not sufficient every-day gifts to manage a\r\nshying horse, made us feel as if we were ourselves again.  Miss Pole\r\ncame with her little basket at all hours of the evening, as if her\r\nlonely house and the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by\r\nthat \"murderous gang\"; Mrs Forrester said she thought that neither Jenny\r\nnor she need mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in Darkness\r\nLane, for surely the power was never given to such beings to harm those\r\nwho went about to try to do what little good was in their power, to\r\nwhich Jenny tremblingly assented; but the mistress's theory had little\r\neffect on the maid's practice until she had sewn two pieces of red\r\nflannel in the shape of a cross on her inner garment.",
    "I found Miss Matty covering her penny ball-the ball that she used to\r\nroll under her bed-with gay-coloured worsted in rainbow stripes.",
    "\"My dear,\" said she, \"my heart is sad for that little careworn child.\r\nAlthough her father is a conjuror, she looks as if she had never had a\r\ngood game of play in her life.  I used to make very pretty balls in this\r\nway when I was a girl, and I thought I would try if I could not make\r\nthis one smart and take it to Phoebe this afternoon.  I think 'the gang'\r\nmust have left the neighbourhood, for one does not hear any more of\r\ntheir violence and robbery now.\"",
    "We were all of us far too full of the signor's precarious state to talk\r\neither about robbers or ghosts.  Indeed, Lady Glenmire said she never\r\nhad heard of any actual robberies, except that two little boys had\r\nstolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard, and that some eggs had\r\nbeen missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.  But that was\r\nexpecting too much of us; we could not acknowledge that we had only had\r\nthis small foundation for all our panic.  Miss Pole drew herself up at\r\nthis remark of Lady Glenmire's, and said \"that she wished she could\r\nagree with her as to the very small reason we had had for alarm, but\r\nwith the recollection of a man disguised as a woman who had endeavoured\r\nto force himself into her house while his confederates waited outside;\r\nwith the knowledge gained from Lady Glenmire herself, of the footprints\r\nseen on Mrs Jamieson's flower borders; with the fact before her of the\r\naudacious robbery committed on Mr Hoggins at his own door\"-But here Lady\r\nGlenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether\r\nthis last story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of\r\na cat; she grew so red while she was saying all this that I was not\r\nsurprised at Miss Pole's manner of bridling up, and I am certain, if\r\nLady Glenmire had not been \"her ladyship,\" we should have had a more\r\nemphatic contradiction than the \"Well, to be sure!\" and similar\r\nfragmentary ejaculations, which were all that she ventured upon in my\r\nlady's presence.  But when she was gone Miss Pole began a long\r\ncongratulation to Miss Matty that so far they had escaped marriage,\r\nwhich she noticed always made people credulous to the last degree;\r\nindeed, she thought it argued great natural credulity in a woman if she\r\ncould not keep herself from being married; and in what Lady Glenmire had\r\nsaid about Mr Hoggins's robbery we had a specimen of what people came to\r\nif they gave way to such a weakness; evidently Lady Glenmire would\r\nswallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped-up story about a\r\nneck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to impose on Miss\r\nPole, only she had always been on her guard against believing too much\r\nof what men said.",
    "We were thankful, as Miss Pole desired us to be, that we had never been\r\nmarried; but I think, of the two, we were even more thankful that the\r\nrobbers had left Cranford; at least I judge so from a speech of Miss\r\nMatty's that evening, as we sat over the fire, in which she evidently\r\nlooked upon a husband as a great protector against thieves, burglars,\r\nand ghosts; and said that she did not think that she should dare to be\r\nalways warning young people against matrimony, as Miss Pole did\r\ncontinually; to be sure, marriage was a risk, as she saw, now she had\r\nhad some experience; but she remembered the time when she had looked\r\nforward to being married as much as any one.",
    "\"Not to any particular person, my dear,\" said she, hastily checking\r\nherself up, as if she were afraid of having admitted too much; \"only the\r\nold story, you know, of ladies always saying, '_When_ I marry,' and\r\ngentlemen, '_If_ I marry.'\"  It was a joke spoken in rather a sad tone,\r\nand I doubt if either of us smiled; but I could not see Miss Matty's\r\nface by the flickering fire-light.  In a little while she continued-",
    "\"But, after all, I have not told you the truth.  It is so long ago, and\r\nno one ever knew how much I thought of it at the time, unless, indeed,\r\nmy dear mother guessed; but I may say that there was a time when I did\r\nnot think I should have been only Miss Matty Jenkyns all my life; for\r\neven if I did meet with any one who wished to marry me now (and, as Miss\r\nPole says, one is never too safe), I could not take him-I hope he would\r\nnot take it too much to heart, but I could _not_ take him-or any one but\r\nthe person I once thought I should be married to; and he is dead and\r\ngone, and he never knew how it all came about that I said 'No,' when I\r\nhad thought many and many a time-Well, it's no matter what I thought.\r\nGod ordains it all, and I am very happy, my dear.  No one has such kind\r\nfriends as I,\" continued she, taking my hand and holding it in hers.",
    "If I had never known of Mr Holbrook, I could have said something in this\r\npause, but as I had, I could not think of anything that would come in\r\nnaturally, and so we both kept silence for a little time.",
    "\"My father once made us,\" she began, \"keep a diary, in two columns; on\r\none side we were to put down in the morning what we thought would be the\r\ncourse and events of the coming day, and at night we were to put down on\r\nthe other side what really had happened.  It would be to some people\r\nrather a sad way of telling their lives,\" (a tear dropped upon my hand\r\nat these words)-\"I don't mean that mine has been sad, only so very\r\ndifferent to what I expected.  I remember, one winter's evening, sitting\r\nover our bedroom fire with Deborah-I remember it as if it were\r\nyesterday-and we were planning our future lives, both of us were\r\nplanning, though only she talked about it.  She said she should like to\r\nmarry an archdeacon, and write his charges; and you know, my dear, she\r\nnever was married, and, for aught I know, she never spoke to an\r\nunmarried archdeacon in her life.  I never was ambitious, nor could I\r\nhave written charges, but I thought I could manage a house (my mother\r\nused to call me her right hand), and I was always so fond of little\r\nchildren-the shyest babies would stretch out their little arms to come\r\nto me; when I was a girl, I was half my leisure time nursing in the\r\nneighbouring cottages; but I don't know how it was, when I grew sad and\r\ngrave-which I did a year or two after this time-the little things drew\r\nback from me, and I am afraid I lost the knack, though I am just as fond\r\nof children as ever, and have a strange yearning at my heart whenever I\r\nsee a mother with her baby in her arms.  Nay, my dear\" (and by a sudden\r\nblaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred coals, I saw that her\r\neyes were full of tears-gazing intently on some vision of what might\r\nhave been), \"do you know I dream sometimes that I have a little\r\nchild-always the same-a little girl of about two years old; she never\r\ngrows older, though I have dreamt about her for many years.  I don't\r\nthink I ever dream of any words or sound she makes; she is very\r\nnoiseless and still, but she comes to me when she is very sorry or very\r\nglad, and I have wakened with the clasp of her dear little arms round my\r\nneck.  Only last night-perhaps because I had gone to sleep thinking of\r\nthis ball for Phoebe-my little darling came in my dream, and put up her\r\nmouth to be kissed, just as I have seen real babies do to real mothers\r\nbefore going to bed.  But all this is nonsense, dear! only don't be\r\nfrightened by Miss Pole from being married.  I can fancy it may be a\r\nvery happy state, and a little credulity helps one on through life very\r\nsmoothly-better than always doubting and doubting and seeing\r\ndifficulties and disagreeables in everything.\"",
    "[Picture: Would stretch out their little arms]",
    "If I had been inclined to be daunted from matrimony, it would not have\r\nbeen Miss Pole to do it; it would have been the lot of poor Signor\r\nBrunoni and his wife.  And yet again, it was an encouragement to see\r\nhow, through all their cares and sorrows, they thought of each other and\r\nnot of themselves; and how keen were their joys, if they only passed\r\nthrough each other, or through the little Phoebe.",
    "The signora told me, one day, a good deal about their lives up to this\r\nperiod.  It began by my asking her whether Miss Pole's story of the\r\ntwin-brothers were true; it sounded so wonderful a likeness, that I\r\nshould have had my doubts, if Miss Pole had not been unmarried.  But the\r\nsignora, or (as we found out she preferred to be called) Mrs Brown, said\r\nit was quite true; that her brother-in-law was by many taken for her\r\nhusband, which was of great assistance to them in their profession;\r\n\"though,\" she continued, \"how people can mistake Thomas for the real\r\nSignor Brunoni, I can't conceive; but he says they do; so I suppose I\r\nmust believe him.  Not but what he is a very good man; I am sure I don't\r\nknow how we should have paid our bill at the 'Rising Sun' but for the\r\nmoney he sends; but people must know very little about art if they can\r\ntake him for my husband.  Why, Miss, in the ball trick, where my husband\r\nspreads his fingers wide, and throws out his little finger with quite an\r\nair and a grace, Thomas just clumps up his hand like a fist, and might\r\nhave ever so many balls hidden in it.  Besides, he has never been in\r\nIndia, and knows nothing of the proper sit of a turban.\"",
    "\"Have you been in India?\" said I, rather astonished.",
    "\"Oh, yes! many a year, ma'am.  Sam was a sergeant in the 31st; and when\r\nthe regiment was ordered to India, I drew a lot to go, and I was more\r\nthankful than I can tell; for it seemed as if it would only be a slow\r\ndeath to me to part from my husband.  But, indeed, ma'am, if I had known\r\nall, I don't know whether I would not rather have died there and then\r\nthan gone through what I have done since.  To be sure, I've been able to\r\ncomfort Sam, and to be with him; but, ma'am, I've lost six children,\"\r\nsaid she, looking up at me with those strange eyes that I've never\r\nnoticed but in mothers of dead children-with a kind of wild look in\r\nthem, as if seeking for what they never more might find.  \"Yes!  Six\r\nchildren died off, like little buds nipped untimely, in that cruel\r\nIndia.  I thought, as each died, I never could-I never would-love a\r\nchild again; and when the next came, it had not only its own love, but\r\nthe deeper love that came from the thoughts of its little dead brothers\r\nand sisters.  And when Phoebe was coming, I said to my husband, 'Sam,\r\nwhen the child is born, and I am strong, I shall leave you; it will cut\r\nmy heart cruel; but if this baby dies too, I shall go mad; the madness\r\nis in me now; but if you let me go down to Calcutta, carrying my baby\r\nstep by step, it will, maybe, work itself off; and I will save, and I\r\nwill hoard, and I will beg-and I will die, to get a passage home to\r\nEngland, where our baby may live?'  God bless him! he said I might go;\r\nand he saved up his pay, and I saved every pice I could get for washing\r\nor any way; and when Phoebe came, and I grew strong again, I set off.\r\nIt was very lonely; through the thick forests, dark again with their\r\nheavy trees-along by the river's side (but I had been brought up near\r\nthe Avon in Warwickshire, so that flowing noise sounded like home)-from\r\nstation to station, from Indian village to village, I went along,\r\ncarrying my child.  I had seen one of the officer's ladies with a little\r\npicture, ma'am-done by a Catholic foreigner, ma'am-of the Virgin and the\r\nlittle Saviour, ma'am.  She had him on her arm, and her form was softly\r\ncurled round him, and their cheeks touched.  Well, when I went to bid\r\ngood-bye to this lady, for whom I had washed, she cried sadly; for she,\r\ntoo, had lost her children, but she had not another to save, like me;\r\nand I was bold enough to ask her would she give me that print.  And she\r\ncried the more, and said her children were with that little blessed\r\nJesus; and gave it me, and told me that she had heard it had been\r\npainted on the bottom of a cask, which made it have that round shape.\r\nAnd when my body was very weary, and my heart was sick (for there were\r\ntimes when I misdoubted if I could ever reach my home, and there were\r\ntimes when I thought of my husband, and one time when I thought my baby\r\nwas dying), I took out that picture and looked at it, till I could have\r\nthought the mother spoke to me, and comforted me.  And the natives were\r\nvery kind.  We could not understand one another; but they saw my baby on\r\nmy breast, and they came out to me, and brought me rice and milk, and\r\nsometimes flowers-I have got some of the flowers dried.  Then, the next\r\nmorning, I was so tired; and they wanted me to stay with them-I could\r\ntell that-and tried to frighten me from going into the deep woods,\r\nwhich, indeed, looked very strange and dark; but it seemed to me as if\r\nDeath was following me to take my baby away from me; and as if I must go\r\non, and on-and I thought how God had cared for mothers ever since the\r\nworld was made, and would care for me; so I bade them good-bye, and set\r\noff afresh.  And once when my baby was ill, and both she and I needed\r\nrest, He led me to a place where I found a kind Englishman lived, right\r\nin the midst of the natives.\"",
    "\"And you reached Calcutta safely at last?\"",
    "\"Yes, safely!  Oh! when I knew I had only two days' journey more before\r\nme, I could not help it, ma'am-it might be idolatry, I cannot tell-but I\r\nwas near one of the native temples, and I went into it with my baby to\r\nthank God for His great mercy; for it seemed to me that where others had\r\nprayed before to their God, in their joy or in their agony, was of\r\nitself a sacred place.  And I got as servant to an invalid lady, who\r\ngrew quite fond of my baby aboard-ship; and, in two years' time, Sam\r\nearned his discharge, and came home to me, and to our child.  Then he\r\nhad to fix on a trade; but he knew of none; and once, once upon a time,\r\nhe had learnt some tricks from an Indian juggler; so he set up\r\nconjuring, and it answered so well that he took Thomas to help him-as\r\nhis man, you know, not as another conjuror, though Thomas has set it up\r\nnow on his own hook. But it has been a great help to us that likeness\r\nbetween the twins, and made a good many tricks go off well that they\r\nmade up together.  And Thomas is a good brother, only he has not the\r\nfine carriage of my husband, so that I can't think how he can be taken\r\nfor Signor Brunoni himself, as he says he is.\"",
    "\"Poor little Phoebe!\" said I, my thoughts going back to the baby she\r\ncarried all those hundred miles.",
    "\"Ah! you may say so!  I never thought I should have reared her, though,\r\nwhen she fell ill at Chunderabaddad; but that good, kind Aga Jenkyns\r\ntook us in, which I believe was the very saving of her.\"",
    "\"Jenkyns!\" said I.",
    "\"Yes, Jenkyns.  I shall think all people of that name are kind; for here\r\nis that nice old lady who comes every day to take Phoebe a walk!\"",
    "But an idea had flashed through my head; could the Aga Jenkyns be the\r\nlost Peter?  True he was reported by many to be dead.  But, equally\r\ntrue, some had said that he had arrived at the dignity of Great Lama of\r\nThibet. Miss Matty thought he was alive.  I would make further inquiry.",
    ".\r\nENGAGED TO BE MARRIED",
    "WAS the \"poor Peter\" of Cranford the Aga Jenkyns of Chunderabaddad, or\r\nwas he not?  As somebody says, that was the question.",
    "In my own home, whenever people had nothing else to do, they blamed me\r\nfor want of discretion.  Indiscretion was my bug-bear fault.  Everybody\r\nhas a bug-bear fault, a sort of standing characteristic-a _pi\u00e8ce de\r\nr\u00e9sistance_ for their friends to cut at; and in general they cut and\r\ncome again.  I was tired of being called indiscreet and incautious; and\r\nI determined for once to prove myself a model of prudence and wisdom.  I\r\nwould not even hint my suspicions respecting the Aga.  I would collect\r\nevidence and carry it home to lay before my father, as the family friend\r\nof the two Miss Jenkynses.",
    "In my search after facts, I was often reminded of a description my\r\nfather had once given of a ladies' committee that he had had to preside\r\nover. He said he could not help thinking of a passage in Dickens, which\r\nspoke of a chorus in which every man took the tune he knew best, and\r\nsang it to his own satisfaction.  So, at this charitable committee,\r\nevery lady took the subject uppermost in her mind, and talked about it\r\nto her own great contentment, but not much to the advancement of the\r\nsubject they had met to discuss.  But even that committee could have\r\nbeen nothing to the Cranford ladies when I attempted to gain some clear\r\nand definite information as to poor Peter's height, appearance, and when\r\nand where he was seen and heard of last.  For instance, I remember\r\nasking Miss Pole (and I thought the question was very opportune, for I\r\nput it when I met her at a call at Mrs Forrester's, and both the ladies\r\nhad known Peter, and I imagined that they might refresh each other's\r\nmemories)-I asked Miss Pole what was the very last thing they had ever\r\nheard about him; and then she named the absurd report to which I have\r\nalluded, about his having been elected Great Lama of Thibet; and this\r\nwas a signal for each lady to go off on her separate idea.  Mrs\r\nForrester's start was made on the veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh-whether\r\nI thought he was meant for the Great Lama, though Peter was not so ugly,\r\nindeed rather handsome, if he had not been freckled.  I was thankful to\r\nsee her double upon Peter; but, in a moment, the delusive lady was off\r\nupon Rowland's Kalydor, and the merits of cosmetics and hair oils in\r\ngeneral, and holding forth so fluently that I turned to listen to Miss\r\nPole, who (through the llamas, the beasts of burden) had got to Peruvian\r\nbonds, and the share market, and her poor opinion of joint-stock banks\r\nin general, and of that one in particular in which Miss Matty's money\r\nwas invested.  In vain I put in \"When was it-in what year was it that\r\nyou heard that Mr Peter was the Great Lama?\"  They only joined issue to\r\ndispute whether llamas were carnivorous animals or not; in which dispute\r\nthey were not quite on fair grounds, as Mrs Forrester (after they had\r\ngrown warm and cool again) acknowledged that she always confused\r\ncarnivorous and graminivorous together, just as she did horizontal and\r\nperpendicular; but then she apologised for it very prettily, by saying\r\nthat in her day the only use people made of four-syllabled words was to\r\nteach how they should be spelt.",
    "The only fact I gained from this conversation was that certainly Peter\r\nhad last been heard of in India, \"or that neighbourhood\"; and that this\r\nscanty intelligence of his whereabouts had reached Cranford in the year\r\nwhen Miss Pole had brought her Indian muslin gown, long since worn out\r\n(we washed it and mended it, and traced its decline and fall into a\r\nwindow-blind before we could go on); and in a year when Wombwell came to\r\nCranford, because Miss Matty had wanted to see an elephant in order that\r\nshe might the better imagine Peter riding on one; and had seen a\r\nboa-constrictor too, which was more than she wished to imagine in her\r\nfancy-pictures of Peter's locality; and in a year when Miss Jenkyns had\r\nlearnt some piece of poetry off by heart, and used to say, at all the\r\nCranford parties, how Peter was \"surveying mankind from China to Peru,\"\r\nwhich everybody had thought very grand, and rather appropriate, because\r\nIndia was between China and Peru, if you took care to turn the globe to\r\nthe left instead of the right.",
    "I suppose all these inquiries of mine, and the consequent curiosity\r\nexcited in the minds of my friends, made us blind and deaf to what was\r\ngoing on around us.  It seemed to me as if the sun rose and shone, and\r\nas if the rain rained on Cranford, just as usual, and I did not notice\r\nany sign of the times that could be considered as a prognostic of any\r\nuncommon event; and, to the best of my belief, not only Miss Matty and\r\nMrs Forrester, but even Miss Pole herself, whom we looked upon as a kind\r\nof prophetess, from the knack she had of foreseeing things before they\r\ncame to pass-although she did not like to disturb her friends by telling\r\nthem her foreknowledge-even Miss Pole herself was breathless with\r\nastonishment when she came to tell us of the astounding piece of news.\r\nBut I must recover myself; the contemplation of it, even at this\r\ndistance of time, has taken away my breath and my grammar, and unless I\r\nsubdue my emotion, my spelling will go too.",
    "We were sitting-Miss Matty and I-much as usual, she in the blue chintz\r\neasy-chair, with her back to the light, and her knitting in her hand, I\r\nreading aloud the _St James's Chronicle_.  A few minutes more, and we\r\nshould have gone to make the little alterations in dress usual before\r\ncalling-time (twelve o'clock) in Cranford.  I remember the scene and the\r\ndate well.  We had been talking of the signor's rapid recovery since\r\nthe warmer weather had set in, and praising Mr Hoggins's skill, and\r\nlamenting his want of refinement and manner (it seems a curious\r\ncoincidence that this should have been our subject, but so it was), when\r\na knock was heard-a caller's knock-three distinct taps-and we were\r\nflying (that is to say, Miss Matty could not walk very fast, having had\r\na touch of rheumatism) to our rooms, to change cap and collars, when\r\nMiss Pole arrested us by calling out, as she came up the stairs, \"Don't\r\ngo-I can't wait-it is not twelve, I know-but never mind your dress-I\r\nmust speak to you.\"  We did our best to look as if it was not we who had\r\nmade the hurried movement, the sound of which she had heard; for, of\r\ncourse, we did not like to have it supposed that we had any old clothes\r\nthat it was convenient to wear out in the \"sanctuary of home,\" as Miss\r\nJenkyns once prettily called the back parlour, where she was tying up\r\npreserves.  So we threw our gentility with double force into our\r\nmanners, and very genteel we were for two minutes while Miss Pole\r\nrecovered breath, and excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her\r\nhands in amazement, and bringing them down in silence, as if what she\r\nhad to say was too big for words, and could only be expressed by\r\npantomime.",
    "\"What do you think, Miss Matty?  What _do_ you think?  Lady Glenmire is\r\nto marry-is to be married, I mean-Lady Glenmire-Mr Hoggins-Mr Hoggins is\r\ngoing to marry Lady Glenmire!\"",
    "\"Marry!\" said we.  \"Marry!  Madness!\"",
    "[Picture: What do you think, Miss Matty]",
    "\"Marry!\" said Miss Pole, with the decision that belonged to her\r\ncharacter.  \"_I_ said marry! as you do; and I also said, 'What a fool my\r\nlady is going to make of herself!'  I could have said 'Madness!' but I\r\ncontrolled myself, for it was in a public shop that I heard of it.\r\nWhere feminine delicacy is gone to, I don't know!  You and I, Miss\r\nMatty, would have been ashamed to have known that our marriage was\r\nspoken of in a grocer's shop, in the hearing of shopmen!\"",
    "\"But,\" said Miss Matty, sighing as one recovering from a blow, \"perhaps\r\nit is not true.  Perhaps we are doing her injustice.\"",
    "\"No,\" said Miss Pole.  \"I have taken care to ascertain that.  I went\r\nstraight to Mrs Fitz-Adam, to borrow a cookery-book which I knew she\r\nhad; and I introduced my congratulations _\u00e0 propos_ of the difficulty\r\ngentlemen must have in house-keeping; and Mrs Fitz-Adam bridled up, and\r\nsaid that she believed it was true, though how and where I could have\r\nheard it she did not know.  She said her brother and Lady Glenmire had\r\ncome to an understanding at last.  'Understanding!' such a coarse word!\r\nBut my lady will have to come down to many a want of refinement.  I have\r\nreason to believe Mr Hoggins sups on bread-and-cheese and beer every\r\nnight.",
    "\"Marry!\" said Miss Matty once again.  \"Well!  I never thought of it.\r\nTwo people that we know going to be married.  It's coming very near!\"",
    "\"So near that my heart stopped beating when I heard of it, while you\r\nmight have counted twelve,\" said Miss Pole.",
    "\"One does not know whose turn may come next.  Here, in Cranford, poor\r\nLady Glenmire might have thought herself safe,\" said Miss Matty, with a\r\ngentle pity in her tones.",
    "\"Bah!\" said Miss Pole, with a toss of her head.  \"Don't you remember\r\npoor dear Captain Brown's song 'Tibbie Fowler,' and the line-",
    "'Set her on the Tintock tap,\r\n    The wind will blaw a man till her.'\"",
    "\"That was because 'Tibbie Fowler' was rich, I think.\"",
    "\"Well! there was a kind of attraction about Lady Glenmire that I, for\r\none, should be ashamed to have.\"",
    "I put in my wonder.  \"But how can she have fancied Mr Hoggins?  I am not\r\nsurprised that Mr Hoggins has liked her.\"",
    "\"Oh!  I don't know.  Mr Hoggins is rich, and very pleasant-looking,\"\r\nsaid Miss Matty, \"and very good-tempered and kind-hearted.\"",
    "\"She has married for an establishment, that's it.  I suppose she takes\r\nthe surgery with it,\" said Miss Pole, with a little dry laugh at her own\r\njoke.  But, like many people who think they have made a severe and\r\nsarcastic speech, which yet is clever of its kind, she began to relax in\r\nher grimness from the moment when she made this allusion to the surgery;\r\nand we turned to speculate on the way in which Mrs Jamieson would\r\nreceive the news.  The person whom she had left in charge of her house\r\nto keep off followers from her maids to set up a follower of her own!\r\nAnd that follower a man whom Mrs Jamieson had tabooed as vulgar, and\r\ninadmissible to Cranford society, not merely on account of his name, but\r\nbecause of his voice, his complexion, his boots, smelling of the stable,\r\nand himself, smelling of drugs.  Had he ever been to see Lady Glenmire\r\nat Mrs Jamieson's?  Chloride of lime would not purify the house in its\r\nowner's estimation if he had.  Or had their interviews been confined to\r\nthe occasional meetings in the chamber of the poor sick conjuror, to\r\nwhom, with all our sense of the _m\u00e9salliance_, we could not help\r\nallowing that they had both been exceedingly kind?  And now it turned\r\nout that a servant of Mrs Jamieson's had been ill, and Mr Hoggins had\r\nbeen attending her for some weeks.  So the wolf had got into the fold,\r\nand now he was carrying off the shepherdess.  What would Mrs Jamieson\r\nsay?  We looked into the darkness of futurity as a child gazes after a\r\nrocket up in the cloudy sky, full of wondering expectation of the\r\nrattle, the discharge, and the brilliant shower of sparks and light.\r\nThen we brought ourselves down to earth and the present time by\r\nquestioning each other (being all equally ignorant, and all equally\r\nwithout the slightest data to build any conclusions upon) as to when IT\r\nwould take place?  Where?  How much a year Mr Hoggins had?  Whether she\r\nwould drop her title?  And how Martha and the other correct servants in\r\nCranford would ever be brought to announce a married couple as Lady\r\nGlenmire and Mr Hoggins?  But would they be visited?  Would Mrs Jamieson\r\nlet us?  Or must we choose between the Honourable Mrs Jamieson and the\r\ndegraded Lady Glenmire?  We all liked Lady Glenmire the best.  She was\r\nbright, and kind, and sociable, and agreeable; and Mrs Jamieson was\r\ndull, and inert, and pompous, and tiresome.  But we had acknowledged the\r\nsway of the latter so long, that it seemed like a kind of disloyalty now\r\neven to meditate disobedience to the prohibition we anticipated.",
    "Mrs Forrester surprised us in our darned caps and patched collars; and\r\nwe forgot all about them in our eagerness to see how she would bear the\r\ninformation, which we honourably left to Miss Pole, to impart, although,\r\nif we had been inclined to take unfair advantage, we might have rushed\r\nin ourselves, for she had a most out-of-place fit of coughing for five\r\nminutes after Mrs Forrester entered the room.  I shall never forget the\r\nimploring expression of her eyes, as she looked at us over her\r\npocket-handkerchief.  They said, as plain as words could speak, \"Don't\r\nlet Nature deprive me of the treasure which is mine, although for a time\r\nI can make no use of it.\"  And we did not.",
    "Mrs Forrester's surprise was equal to ours; and her sense of injury\r\nrather greater, because she had to feel for her Order, and saw more\r\nfully than we could do how such conduct brought stains on the\r\naristocracy.",
    "When she and Miss Pole left us we endeavoured to subside into calmness;\r\nbut Miss Matty was really upset by the intelligence she had heard.  She\r\nreckoned it up, and it was more than fifteen years since she had heard\r\nof any of her acquaintance going to be married, with the one exception\r\nof Miss Jessie Brown; and, as she said, it gave her quite a shock, and\r\nmade her feel as if she could not think what would happen next.",
    "I don't know whether it is a fancy of mine, or a real fact, but I have\r\nnoticed that, just after the announcement of an engagement in any set,\r\nthe unmarried ladies in that set flutter out in an unusual gaiety and\r\nnewness of dress, as much as to say, in a tacit and unconscious manner,\r\n\"We also are spinsters.\"  Miss Matty and Miss Pole talked and thought\r\nmore about bonnets, gowns, caps, and shawls, during the fortnight that\r\nsucceeded this call, than I had known them do for years before.  But it\r\nmight be the spring weather, for it was a warm and pleasant March; and\r\nmerinoes and beavers, and woollen materials of all sorts were but\r\nungracious receptacles of the bright sun's glancing rays.  It had not\r\nbeen Lady Glenmire's dress that had won Mr Hoggins's heart, for she went\r\nabout on her errands of kindness more shabby than ever.  Although in the\r\nhurried glimpses I caught of her at church or elsewhere she appeared\r\nrather to shun meeting any of her friends, her face seemed to have\r\nalmost something of the flush of youth in it; her lips looked redder and\r\nmore trembling full than in their old compressed state, and her eyes\r\ndwelt on all things with a lingering light, as if she was learning to\r\nlove Cranford and its belongings.  Mr Hoggins looked broad and radiant,\r\nand creaked up the middle aisle at church in a brand-new pair of\r\ntop-boots-an audible, as well as visible, sign of his purposed change of\r\nstate; for the tradition went, that the boots he had worn till now were\r\nthe identical pair in which he first set out on his rounds in Cranford\r\ntwenty-five years ago; only they had been new-pieced, high and low, top\r\nand bottom, heel and sole, black leather and brown leather, more times\r\nthan any one could tell.",
    "None of the ladies in Cranford chose to sanction the marriage by\r\ncongratulating either of the parties.  We wished to ignore the whole\r\naffair until our liege lady, Mrs Jamieson, returned.  Till she came back\r\nto give us our cue, we felt that it would be better to consider the\r\nengagement in the same light as the Queen of Spain's legs-facts which\r\ncertainly existed, but the less said about the better.  This restraint\r\nupon our tongues-for you see if we did not speak about it to any of the\r\nparties concerned, how could we get answers to the questions that we\r\nlonged to ask?-was beginning to be irksome, and our idea of the dignity\r\nof silence was paling before our curiosity, when another direction was\r\ngiven to our thoughts, by an announcement on the part of the principal\r\nshopkeeper of Cranford, who ranged the trades from grocer and\r\ncheesemonger to man-milliner, as occasion required, that the spring\r\nfashions were arrived, and would be exhibited on the following Tuesday\r\nat his rooms in High Street.  Now Miss Matty had been only waiting for\r\nthis before buying herself a new silk gown.  I had offered, it is true,\r\nto send to Drumble for patterns, but she had rejected my proposal,\r\ngently implying that she had not forgotten her disappointment about the\r\nsea-green turban.  I was thankful that I was on the spot now, to\r\ncounteract the dazzling fascination of any yellow or scarlet silk.",
    "I must say a word or two here about myself.  I have spoken of my\r\nfather's old friendship for the Jenkyns family; indeed, I am not sure if\r\nthere was not some distant relationship.  He had willingly allowed me to\r\nremain all the winter at Cranford, in consideration of a letter which\r\nMiss Matty had written to him about the time of the panic, in which I\r\nsuspect she had exaggerated my powers and my bravery as a defender of\r\nthe house.  But now that the days were longer and more cheerful, he was\r\nbeginning to urge the necessity of my return; and I only delayed in a\r\nsort of odd forlorn hope that if I could obtain any clear information, I\r\nmight make the account given by the signora of the Aga Jenkyns tally\r\nwith that of \"poor Peter,\" his appearance and disappearance, which I had\r\nwinnowed out of the conversation of Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester.",
    ".\r\nSTOPPED PAYMENT",
    "THE very Tuesday morning on which Mr Johnson was going to show the\r\nfashions, the post-woman brought two letters to the house.  I say the\r\npost-woman, but I should say the postman's wife.  He was a lame\r\nshoemaker, a very clean, honest man, much respected in the town; but he\r\nnever brought the letters round except on unusual occasions, such as\r\nChristmas Day or Good Friday; and on those days the letters, which\r\nshould have been delivered at eight in the morning, did not make their\r\nappearance until two or three in the afternoon, for every one liked poor\r\nThomas, and gave him a welcome on these festive occasions.  He used to\r\nsay, \"He was welly stawed wi' eating, for there were three or four\r\nhouses where nowt would serve 'em but he must share in their breakfast;\"\r\nand by the time he had done his last breakfast, he came to some other\r\nfriend who was beginning dinner; but come what might in the way of\r\ntemptation, Tom was always sober, civil, and smiling; and, as Miss\r\nJenkyns used to say, it was a lesson in patience, that she doubted not\r\nwould call out that precious quality in some minds, where, but for\r\nThomas, it might have lain dormant and undiscovered.  Patience was\r\ncertainly very dormant in Miss Jenkyns's mind.  She was always expecting\r\nletters, and always drumming on the table till the post-woman had called\r\nor gone past.  On Christmas Day and Good Friday she drummed from\r\nbreakfast till church, from church-time till two o'clock-unless when the\r\nfire wanted stirring, when she invariably knocked down the fire-irons,\r\nand scolded Miss Matty for it. But equally certain was the hearty\r\nwelcome and the good dinner for Thomas; Miss Jenkyns standing over him\r\nlike a bold dragoon, questioning him as to his children-what they were\r\ndoing-what school they went to; upbraiding him if another was likely to\r\nmake its appearance, but sending even the little babies the shilling and\r\nthe mince-pie which was her gift to all the children, with half-a-crown\r\nin addition for both father and mother.  The post was not half of so\r\nmuch consequence to dear Miss Matty; but not for the world would she\r\nhave diminished Thomas's welcome and his dole, though I could see that\r\nshe felt rather shy over the ceremony, which had been regarded by Miss\r\nJenkyns as a glorious opportunity for giving advice and benefiting her\r\nfellow-creatures.  Miss Matty would steal the money all in a lump into\r\nhis hand, as if she were ashamed of herself.  Miss Jenkyns gave him each\r\nindividual coin separate, with a \"There! that's for yourself; that's for\r\nJenny,\" etc.  Miss Matty would even beckon Martha out of the kitchen\r\nwhile he ate his food: and once, to my knowledge, winked at its rapid\r\ndisappearance into a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief.  Miss Jenkyns\r\nalmost scolded him if he did not leave a clean plate, however heaped it\r\nmight have been, and gave an injunction with every mouthful.",
    "[Picture: Standing over him like a bold dragoon]",
    "I have wandered a long way from the two letters that awaited us on the\r\nbreakfast-table that Tuesday morning.  Mine was from my father.  Miss\r\nMatty's was printed.  My father's was just a man's letter; I mean it was\r\nvery dull, and gave no information beyond that he was well, that they\r\nhad had a good deal of rain, that trade was very stagnant, and there\r\nwere many disagreeable rumours afloat.  He then asked me if I knew\r\nwhether Miss Matty still retained her shares in the Town and County\r\nBank, as there were very unpleasant reports about it; though nothing\r\nmore than he had always foreseen, and had prophesied to Miss Jenkyns\r\nyears ago, when she would invest their little property in it-the only\r\nunwise step that clever woman had ever taken, to his knowledge (the only\r\ntime she ever acted against his advice, I knew).  However, if anything\r\nhad gone wrong, of course I was not to think of leaving Miss Matty while\r\nI could be of any use, etc.",
    "\"Who is your letter from, my dear?  Mine is a very civil invitation,\r\nsigned 'Edwin Wilson,' asking me to attend an important meeting of the\r\nshareholders of the Town and County Bank, to be held in Drumble, on\r\nThursday the twenty-first.  I am sure, it is very attentive of them to\r\nremember me.\"",
    "I did not like to hear of this \"important meeting,\" for, though I did\r\nnot know much about business, I feared it confirmed what my father said:\r\nhowever, I thought, ill news always came fast enough, so I resolved to\r\nsay nothing about my alarm, and merely told her that my father was well,\r\nand sent his kind regards to her.  She kept turning over and admiring\r\nher letter.  At last she spoke-",
    "\"I remember their sending one to Deborah just like this; but that I did\r\nnot wonder at, for everybody knew she was so clear-headed.  I am afraid\r\nI could not help them much; indeed, if they came to accounts, I should\r\nbe quite in the way, for I never could do sums in my head.  Deborah, I\r\nknow, rather wished to go, and went so far as to order a new bonnet for\r\nthe occasion: but when the time came she had a bad cold; so they sent\r\nher a very polite account of what they had done.  Chosen a director, I\r\nthink it was.  Do you think they want me to help them to choose a\r\ndirector?  I am sure I should choose your father at once!\"",
    "\"My father has no shares in the bank,\" said I.",
    "\"Oh, no!  I remember.  He objected very much to Deborah's buying any, I\r\nbelieve.  But she was quite the woman of business, and always judged for\r\nherself; and here, you see, they have paid eight per cent. all these\r\nyears.\"",
    "It was a very uncomfortable subject to me, with my half-knowledge; so I\r\nthought I would change the conversation, and I asked at what time she\r\nthought we had better go and see the fashions.  \"Well, my dear,\" she\r\nsaid, \"the thing is this: it is not etiquette to go till after twelve;\r\nbut then, you see, all Cranford will be there, and one does not like to\r\nbe too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world\r\nlooking on.  It is never genteel to be over-curious on these occasions.\r\nDeborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was\r\nnothing new to her; a manner she had caught from Lady Arley, who did see\r\nall the new modes in London, you know.  So I thought we would just slip\r\ndown-for I do want this morning, soon after breakfast half-a-pound of\r\ntea-and then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure, and\r\nsee exactly how my new silk gown must be made; and then, after twelve,\r\nwe could go with our minds disengaged, and free from thoughts of dress.\"",
    "We began to talk of Miss Matty's new silk gown.  I discovered that it\r\nwould be really the first time in her life that she had had to choose\r\nanything of consequence for herself: for Miss Jenkyns had always been\r\nthe more decided character, whatever her taste might have been; and it\r\nis astonishing how such people carry the world before them by the mere\r\nforce of will.  Miss Matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds\r\nwith as much delight as if the five sovereigns, set apart for the\r\npurchase, could buy all the silks in the shop; and (remembering my own\r\nloss of two hours in a toyshop before I could tell on what wonder to\r\nspend a silver threepence) I was very glad that we were going early,\r\nthat dear Miss Matty might have leisure for the delights of perplexity.",
    "If a happy sea-green could be met with, the gown was to be sea-green: if\r\nnot, she inclined to maize, and I to silver gray; and we discussed the\r\nrequisite number of breadths until we arrived at the shop-door.  We were\r\nto buy the tea, select the silk, and then clamber up the iron corkscrew\r\nstairs that led into what was once a loft, though now a fashion\r\nshow-room.",
    "The young men at Mr Johnson's had on their best looks; and their best\r\ncravats, and pivoted themselves over the counter with surprising\r\nactivity.  They wanted to show us upstairs at once; but on the principle\r\nof business first and pleasure afterwards, we stayed to purchase the\r\ntea. Here Miss Matty's absence of mind betrayed itself.  If she was\r\nmade aware that she had been drinking green tea at any time, she always\r\nthought it her duty to lie awake half through the night afterward (I\r\nhave known her take it in ignorance many a time without such effects),\r\nand consequently green tea was prohibited the house; yet to-day she\r\nherself asked for the obnoxious article, under the impression that she\r\nwas talking about the silk.  However, the mistake was soon rectified;\r\nand then the silks were unrolled in good truth.  By this time the shop\r\nwas pretty well filled, for it was Cranford market-day, and many of the\r\nfarmers and country people from the neighbourhood round came in,\r\nsleeking down their hair, and glancing shyly about, from under their\r\neyelids, as anxious to take back some notion of the unusual gaiety to\r\nthe mistress or the lasses at home, and yet feeling that they were out\r\nof place among the smart shopmen and gay shawls and summer prints.  One\r\nhonest-looking man, however, made his way up to the counter at which we\r\nstood, and boldly asked to look at a shawl or two.  The other country\r\nfolk confined themselves to the grocery side; but our neighbour was\r\nevidently too full of some kind intention towards mistress, wife or\r\ndaughter, to be shy; and it soon became a question with me, whether he\r\nor Miss Matty would keep their shopmen the longest time.  He thought\r\neach shawl more beautiful than the last; and, as for Miss Matty, she\r\nsmiled and sighed over each fresh bale that was brought out; one colour\r\nset off another, and the heap together would, as she said, make even the\r\nrainbow look poor.",
    "\"I am afraid,\" said she, hesitating, \"Whichever I choose I shall wish I\r\nhad taken another.  Look at this lovely crimson! it would be so warm in\r\nwinter.  But spring is coming on, you know.  I wish I could have a gown\r\nfor every season,\" said she, dropping her voice-as we all did in\r\nCranford whenever we talked of anything we wished for but could not\r\nafford. \"However,\" she continued in a louder and more cheerful tone, \"it\r\nwould give me a great deal of trouble to take care of them if I had\r\nthem; so, I think, I'll only take one.  But which must it be, my dear?\"",
    "And now she hovered over a lilac with yellow spots, while I pulled out a\r\nquiet sage-green that had faded into insignificance under the more\r\nbrilliant colours, but which was nevertheless a good silk in its humble\r\nway.  Our attention was called off to our neighbour.  He had chosen a\r\nshawl of about thirty shillings' value; and his face looked broadly\r\nhappy, under the anticipation, no doubt, of the pleasant surprise he\r\nwould give to some Molly or Jenny at home; he had tugged a leathern\r\npurse out of his breeches-pocket, and had offered a five-pound note in\r\npayment for the shawl, and for some parcels which had been brought round\r\nto him from the grocery counter; and it was just at this point that he\r\nattracted our notice.  The shopman was examining the note with a\r\npuzzled, doubtful air.",
    "\"Town and County Bank!  I am not sure, sir, but I believe we have\r\nreceived a warning against notes issued by this bank only this morning.\r\nI will just step and ask Mr Johnson, sir; but I'm afraid I must trouble\r\nyou for payment in cash, or in a note of a different bank.\"",
    "I never saw a man's countenance fall so suddenly into dismay and\r\nbewilderment.  It was almost piteous to see the rapid change.",
    "\"Dang it!\" said he, striking his fist down on the table, as if to try\r\nwhich was the harder, \"the chap talks as if notes and gold were to be\r\nhad for the picking up.\"",
    "Miss Matty had forgotten her silk gown in her interest for the man.  I\r\ndon't think she had caught the name of the bank, and in my nervous\r\ncowardice I was anxious that she should not; and so I began admiring the\r\nyellow-spotted lilac gown that I had been utterly condemning only a\r\nminute before.  But it was of no use.",
    "\"What bank was it?  I mean, what bank did your note belong to?\"",
    "\"Town and County Bank.\"",
    "\"Let me see it,\" said she quietly to the shopman, gently taking it out\r\nof his hand, as he brought it back to return it to the farmer.",
    "Mr Johnson was very sorry, but, from information he had received, the\r\nnotes issued by that bank were little better than waste paper.",
    "\"I don't understand it,\" said Miss Matty to me in a low voice.  \"That is\r\nour bank, is it not?-the Town and County Bank?\"",
    "\"Yes,\" said I.  \"This lilac silk will just match the ribbons in your new\r\ncap, I believe,\" I continued, holding up the folds so as to catch the\r\nlight, and wishing that the man would make haste and be gone, and yet\r\nhaving a new wonder, that had only just sprung up, how far it was wise\r\nor right in me to allow Miss Matty to make this expensive purchase, if\r\nthe affairs of the bank were really so bad as the refusal of the note\r\nimplied.",
    "But Miss Matty put on the soft dignified manner, peculiar to her, rarely\r\nused, and yet which became her so well, and laying her hand gently on\r\nmine, she said-",
    "\"Never mind the silks for a few minutes, dear.  I don't understand you,\r\nsir,\" turning now to the shopman, who had been attending to the farmer.\r\n\"Is this a forged note?\"",
    "\"Oh, no, ma'am.  It is a true note of its kind; but you see, ma'am, it\r\nis a joint-stock bank, and there are reports out that it is likely to\r\nbreak. Mr Johnson is only doing his duty, ma'am, as I am sure Mr Dobson\r\nknows.\"",
    "But Mr Dobson could not respond to the appealing bow by any answering\r\nsmile.  He was turning the note absently over in his fingers, looking\r\ngloomily enough at the parcel containing the lately-chosen shawl.",
    "\"It's hard upon a poor man,\" said he, \"as earns every farthing with the\r\nsweat of his brow.  However, there's no help for it.  You must take back\r\nyour shawl, my man; Lizzle must go on with her cloak for a while.  And\r\nyon figs for the little ones-I promised them to 'em-I'll take them; but\r\nthe 'bacco, and the other things\"-",
    "\"I will give you five sovereigns for your note, my good man,\" said Miss\r\nMatty.  \"I think there is some great mistake about it, for I am one of\r\nthe shareholders, and I'm sure they would have told me if things had not\r\nbeen going on right.\"",
    "The shopman whispered a word or two across the table to Miss Matty.  She\r\nlooked at him with a dubious air.",
    "\"Perhaps so,\" said she.  \"But I don't pretend to understand business; I\r\nonly know that if it is going to fail, and if honest people are to lose\r\ntheir money because they have taken our notes-I can't explain myself,\"\r\nsaid she, suddenly becoming aware that she had got into a long sentence\r\nwith four people for audience; \"only I would rather exchange my gold for\r\nthe note, if you please,\" turning to the farmer, \"and then you can take\r\nyour wife the shawl.  It is only going without my gown a few days\r\nlonger,\" she continued, speaking to me.  \"Then, I have no doubt,\r\neverything will be cleared up.\"",
    "\"But if it is cleared up the wrong way?\" said I.",
    "\"Why, then it will only have been common honesty in me, as a\r\nshareholder, to have given this good man the money.  I am quite clear\r\nabout it in my own mind; but, you know, I can never speak quite as\r\ncomprehensibly as others can, only you must give me your note, Mr\r\nDobson, if you please, and go on with your purchases with these\r\nsovereigns.\"",
    "[Picture: You must give me your note, Mr Dobson, if you please]",
    "The man looked at her with silent gratitude-too awkward to put his\r\nthanks into words; but he hung back for a minute or two, fumbling with\r\nhis note.",
    "\"I'm loth to make another one lose instead of me, if it is a loss; but,\r\nyou see, five pounds is a deal of money to a man with a family; and, as\r\nyou say, ten to one in a day or two the note will be as good as gold\r\nagain.\"",
    "\"No hope of that, my friend,\" said the shopman.",
    "\"The more reason why I should take it,\" said Miss Matty quietly.  She\r\npushed her sovereigns towards the man, who slowly laid his note down in\r\nexchange.  \"Thank you.  I will wait a day or two before I purchase any\r\nof these silks; perhaps you will then have a greater choice.  My dear,\r\nwill you come upstairs?\"",
    "We inspected the fashions with as minute and curious an interest as if\r\nthe gown to be made after them had been bought.  I could not see that\r\nthe little event in the shop below had in the least damped Miss Matty's\r\ncuriosity as to the make of sleeves or the sit of skirts.  She once or\r\ntwice exchanged congratulations with me on our private and leisurely\r\nview of the bonnets and shawls; but I was, all the time, not so sure\r\nthat our examination was so utterly private, for I caught glimpses of a\r\nfigure dodging behind the cloaks and mantles; and, by a dexterous move,\r\nI came face to face with Miss Pole, also in morning costume (the\r\nprincipal feature of which was her being without teeth, and wearing a\r\nveil to conceal the deficiency), come on the same errand as ourselves.\r\nBut she quickly took her departure, because, as she said, she had a bad\r\nheadache, and did not feel herself up to conversation.",
    "As we came down through the shop, the civil Mr Johnson was awaiting us;\r\nhe had been informed of the exchange of the note for gold, and with much\r\ngood feeling and real kindness, but with a little want of tact, he\r\nwished to condole with Miss Matty, and impress upon her the true state\r\nof the case.  I could only hope that he had heard an exaggerated rumour\r\nfor he said that her shares were worse than nothing, and that the bank\r\ncould not pay a shilling in the pound.  I was glad that Miss Matty\r\nseemed still a little incredulous; but I could not tell how much of this\r\nwas real or assumed, with that self-control which seemed habitual to\r\nladies of Miss Matty's standing in Cranford, who would have thought\r\ntheir dignity compromised by the slightest expression of surprise,\r\ndismay, or any similar feeling to an inferior in station, or in a public\r\nshop.  However, we walked home very silently.  I am ashamed to say, I\r\nbelieve I was rather vexed and annoyed at Miss Matty's conduct in taking\r\nthe note to herself so decidedly.  I had so set my heart upon her having\r\na new silk gown, which she wanted sadly; in general she was so undecided\r\nanybody might turn her round; in this case I had felt that it was no use\r\nattempting it, but I was not the less put out at the result.",
    "Somehow, after twelve o'clock, we both acknowledged to a sated curiosity\r\nabout the fashions, and to a certain fatigue of body (which was, in\r\nfact, depression of mind) that indisposed us to go out again.  But still\r\nwe never spoke of the note; till, all at once, something possessed me to\r\nask Miss Matty if she would think it her duty to offer sovereigns for\r\nall the notes of the Town and County Bank she met with?  I could have\r\nbitten my tongue out the minute I had said it.  She looked up rather\r\nsadly, and as if I had thrown a new perplexity into her already\r\ndistressed mind; and for a minute or two she did not speak.  Then she\r\nsaid-my own dear Miss Matty-without a shade of reproach in her voice-",
    "\"My dear, I never feel as if my mind was what people call very strong;\r\nand it's often hard enough work for me to settle what I ought to do with\r\nthe case right before me.  I was very thankful to-I was very thankful,\r\nthat I saw my duty this morning, with the poor man standing by me; but\r\nits rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what I should\r\ndo if such and such a thing happened; and, I believe, I had rather wait\r\nand see what really does come; and I don't doubt I shall be helped then\r\nif I don't fidget myself, and get too anxious beforehand.  You know,\r\nlove, I'm not like Deborah.  If Deborah had lived, I've no doubt she\r\nwould have seen after them, before they had got themselves into this\r\nstate.\"",
    "We had neither of us much appetite for dinner, though we tried to talk\r\ncheerfully about indifferent things.  When we returned into the\r\ndrawing-room, Miss Matty unlocked her desk and began to look over her\r\naccount-books.  I was so penitent for what I had said in the morning,\r\nthat I did not choose to take upon myself the presumption to suppose\r\nthat I could assist her; I rather left her alone, as, with puzzled brow,\r\nher eye followed her pen up and down the ruled page.  By-and-by she shut\r\nthe book, locked the desk, and came and drew a chair to mine, where I\r\nsat in moody sorrow over the fire.  I stole my hand into hers; she\r\nclasped it, but did not speak a word.  At last she said, with forced\r\ncomposure in her voice, \"If that bank goes wrong, I shall lose one\r\nhundred and forty-nine pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a year; I\r\nshall only have thirteen pounds a year left.\"  I squeezed her hand hard\r\nand tight.  I did not know what to say.  Presently (it was too dark to\r\nsee her face) I felt her fingers work convulsively in my grasp; and I\r\nknew she was going to speak again.  I heard the sobs in her voice as she\r\nsaid, \"I hope it's not wrong-not wicked-but, oh!  I am so glad poor\r\nDeborah is spared this.  She could not have borne to come down in the\r\nworld-she had such a noble, lofty spirit.\"",
    "This was all she said about the sister who had insisted upon investing\r\ntheir little property in that unlucky bank.  We were later in lighting\r\nthe candle than usual that night, and until that light shamed us into\r\nspeaking, we sat together very silently and sadly.",
    "However, we took to our work after tea with a kind of forced\r\ncheerfulness (which soon became real as far as it went), talking of that\r\nnever-ending wonder, Lady Glenmire's engagement.  Miss Matty was almost\r\ncoming round to think it a good thing.",
    "\"I don't mean to deny that men are troublesome in a house.  I don't\r\njudge from my own experience, for my father was neatness itself, and\r\nwiped his shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman; but still a man\r\nhas a sort of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties, that it\r\nis very pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon.  Now, Lady\r\nGlenmire, instead of being tossed about, and wondering where she is to\r\nsettle, will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people, such\r\nas our good Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester.  And Mr Hoggins is really a\r\nvery personable man; and as for his manners, why, if they are not very\r\npolished, I have known people with very good hearts and very clever\r\nminds too, who were not what some people reckoned refined, but who were\r\nboth true and tender.\"",
    "She fell off into a soft reverie about Mr Holbrook, and I did not\r\ninterrupt her, I was so busy maturing a plan I had had in my mind for\r\nsome days, but which this threatened failure of the bank had brought to\r\na crisis.  That night, after Miss Matty went to bed, I treacherously\r\nlighted the candle again, and sat down in the drawing-room to compose a\r\nletter to the Aga Jenkyns, a letter which should affect him if he were\r\nPeter, and yet seem a mere statement of dry facts if he were a stranger.\r\nThe church clock pealed out two before I had done.",
    "The next morning news came, both official and otherwise, that the Town\r\nand County Bank had stopped payment.  Miss Matty was ruined.",
    "She tried to speak quietly to me; but when she came to the actual fact\r\nthat she would have but about five shillings a week to live upon, she\r\ncould not restrain a few tears.",
    "\"I am not crying for myself, dear,\" said she, wiping them away; \"I\r\nbelieve I am crying for the very silly thought of how my mother would\r\ngrieve if she could know; she always cared for us so much more than for\r\nherself.  But many a poor person has less, and I am not very\r\nextravagant, and, thank God, when the neck of mutton, and Martha's\r\nwages, and the rent are paid, I have not a farthing owing.  Poor Martha!\r\n I think she'll be sorry to leave me.\"",
    "Miss Matty smiled at me through her tears, and she would fain have had\r\nme see only the smile, not the tears.",
    ".\r\nFRIENDS IN NEED",
    "IT was an example to me, and I fancy it might be to many others, to see\r\nhow immediately Miss Matty set about the retrenchment which she knew to\r\nbe right under her altered circumstances.  While she went down to speak\r\nto Martha, and break the intelligence to her, I stole out with my letter\r\nto the Aga Jenkyns, and went to the signor's lodgings to obtain the\r\nexact address.  I bound the signora to secrecy; and indeed her military\r\nmanners had a degree of shortness and reserve in them which made her\r\nalways say as little as possible, except when under the pressure of\r\nstrong excitement.  Moreover (which made my secret doubly sure), the\r\nsignor was now so far recovered as to be looking forward to travelling\r\nand conjuring again in the space of a few days, when he, his wife, and\r\nlittle Phoebe would leave Cranford.  Indeed, I found him looking over a\r\ngreat black and red placard, in which the Signor Brunoni's\r\naccomplishments were set forth, and to which only the name of the town\r\nwhere he would next display them was wanting.  He and his wife were so\r\nmuch absorbed in deciding where the red letters would come in with most\r\neffect (it might have been the Rubric for that matter), that it was some\r\ntime before I could get my question asked privately, and not before I\r\nhad given several decisions, the which I questioned afterwards with\r\nequal wisdom of sincerity as soon as the signor threw in his doubts and\r\nreasons on the important subject. At last I got the address, spelt by\r\nsound, and very queer it looked.  I dropped it in the post on my way\r\nhome, and then for a minute I stood looking at the wooden pane with a\r\ngaping slit which divided me from the letter but a moment ago in my\r\nhand.  It was gone from me like life, never to be recalled.  It would\r\nget tossed about on the sea, and stained with sea-waves perhaps, and be\r\ncarried among palm-trees, and scented with all tropical fragrance; the\r\nlittle piece of paper, but an hour ago so familiar and commonplace, had\r\nset out on its race to the strange wild countries beyond the Ganges!\r\nBut I could not afford to lose much time on this speculation.  I\r\nhastened home, that Miss Matty might not miss me. Martha opened the door\r\nto me, her face swollen with crying.  As soon as she saw me she burst\r\nout afresh, and taking hold of my arm she pulled me in, and banged the\r\ndoor to, in order to ask me if indeed it was all true that Miss Matty\r\nhad been saying.",
    "\"I'll never leave her!  No; I won't.  I telled her so, and said I could\r\nnot think how she could find in her heart to give me warning.  I could\r\nnot have had the face to do it, if I'd been her.  I might ha' been just\r\nas good for nothing as Mrs Fitz-Adam's Rosy, who struck for wages after\r\nliving seven years and a half in one place.  I said I was not one to go\r\nand serve Mammon at that rate; that I knew when I'd got a good missus,\r\nif she didn't know when she'd got a good servant\"-",
    "\"But, Martha,\" said I, cutting in while she wiped her eyes.",
    "\"Don't, 'but Martha' me,\" she replied to my deprecatory tone.",
    "\"Listen to reason\"-",
    "\"I'll not listen to reason,\" she said, now in full possession of her\r\nvoice, which had been rather choked with sobbing.  \"Reason always means\r\nwhat someone else has got to say.  Now I think what I've got to say is\r\ngood enough reason; but reason or not, I'll say it, and I'll stick to\r\nit. I've money in the Savings Bank, and I've a good stock of clothes,\r\nand I'm not going to leave Miss Matty.  No, not if she gives me warning\r\nevery hour in the day!\"",
    "She put her arms akimbo, as much as to say she defied me; and, indeed, I\r\ncould hardly tell how to begin to remonstrate with her, so much did I\r\nfeel that Miss Matty, in her increasing infirmity, needed the attendance\r\nof this kind and faithful woman.",
    "\"Well\"-said I at last.",
    "\"I'm thankful you begin with 'well!'  If you'd have begun with 'but,' as\r\nyou did afore, I'd not ha' listened to you.  Now you may go on.\"",
    "\"I know you would be a great loss to Miss Matty, Martha\"-",
    "\"I telled her so.  A loss she'd never cease to be sorry for,\" broke in\r\nMartha triumphantly.",
    "\"Still, she will have so little-so very little-to live upon, that I\r\ndon't see just now how she could find you food-she will even be pressed\r\nfor her own.  I tell you this, Martha, because I feel you are like a\r\nfriend to dear Miss Matty, but you know she might not like to have it\r\nspoken about.\"",
    "Apparently this was even a blacker view of the subject than Miss Matty\r\nhad presented to her, for Martha just sat down on the first chair that\r\ncame to hand, and cried out loud (we had been standing in the kitchen).",
    "At last she put her apron down, and looking me earnestly in the face,\r\nasked, \"Was that the reason Miss Matty wouldn't order a pudding to-day?\r\nShe said she had no great fancy for sweet things, and you and she would\r\njust have a mutton chop.  But I'll be up to her.  Never you tell, but\r\nI'll make her a pudding, and a pudding she'll like, too, and I'll pay\r\nfor it myself; so mind you see she eats it.  Many a one has been\r\ncomforted in their sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table.\"",
    "I was rather glad that Martha's energy had taken the immediate and\r\npractical direction of pudding-making, for it staved off the quarrelsome\r\ndiscussion as to whether she should or should not leave Miss Matty's\r\nservice.  She began to tie on a clean apron, and otherwise prepare\r\nherself for going to the shop for the butter, eggs, and what else she\r\nmight require.  She would not use a scrap of the articles already in the\r\nhouse for her cookery, but went to an old tea-pot in which her private\r\nstore of money was deposited, and took out what she wanted.",
    "I found Miss Matty very quiet, and not a little sad; but by-and-by she\r\ntried to smile for my sake.  It was settled that I was to write to my\r\nfather, and ask him to come over and hold a consultation, and as soon as\r\nthis letter was despatched we began to talk over future plans.  Miss\r\nMatty's idea was to take a single room, and retain as much of her\r\nfurniture as would be necessary to fit up this, and sell the rest, and\r\nthere to quietly exist upon what would remain after paying the rent.\r\nFor my part, I was more ambitious and less contented.  I thought of all\r\nthe things by which a woman, past middle age, and with the education\r\ncommon to ladies fifty years ago, could earn or add to a living without\r\nmaterially losing caste; but at length I put even this last clause on\r\none side, and wondered what in the world Miss Matty could do.",
    "Teaching was, of course, the first thing that suggested itself.  If Miss\r\nMatty could teach children anything, it would throw her among the little\r\nelves in whom her soul delighted.  I ran over her accomplishments.  Once\r\nupon a time I had heard her say she could play \"Ah! vous dirai-je,\r\nmaman?\" on the piano, but that was long, long ago; that faint shadow of\r\nmusical acquirement had died out years before.  She had also once been\r\nable to trace out patterns very nicely for muslin embroidery, by dint of\r\nplacing a piece of silver paper over the design to be copied, and\r\nholding both against the window-pane while she marked the scollop and\r\neyelet-holes.  But that was her nearest approach to the accomplishment\r\nof drawing, and I did not think it would go very far.  Then again, as to\r\nthe branches of a solid English education-fancy work and the use of the\r\nglobes-such as the mistress of the Ladies' Seminary, to which all the\r\ntradespeople in Cranford sent their daughters, professed to teach.  Miss\r\nMatty's eyes were failing her, and I doubted if she could discover the\r\nnumber of threads in a worsted-work pattern, or rightly appreciate the\r\ndifferent shades required for Queen Adelaide's face in the loyal\r\nwool-work now fashionable in Cranford.  As for the use of the globes, I\r\nhad never been able to find it out myself, so perhaps I was not a good\r\njudge of Miss Matty's capability of instructing in this branch of\r\neducation; but it struck me that equators and tropics, and such mystical\r\ncircles, were very imaginary lines indeed to her, and that she looked\r\nupon the signs of the Zodiac as so many remnants of the Black Art.",
    "What she piqued herself upon, as arts in which she excelled, was making\r\ncandle-lighters, or \"spills\" (as she preferred calling them), of\r\ncoloured paper, cut so as to resemble feathers, and knitting garters in\r\na variety of dainty stitches.  I had once said, on receiving a present\r\nof an elaborate pair, that I should feel quite tempted to drop one of\r\nthem in the street, in order to have it admired; but I found this little\r\njoke (and it was a very little one) was such a distress to her sense of\r\npropriety, and was taken with such anxious, earnest alarm, lest the\r\ntemptation might some day prove too strong for me, that I quite\r\nregretted having ventured upon it.  A present of these\r\ndelicately-wrought garters, a bunch of gay \"spills,\" or a set of cards\r\non which sewing-silk was wound in a mystical manner, were the well-known\r\ntokens of Miss Matty's favour. But would any one pay to have their\r\nchildren taught these arts? or, indeed, would Miss Matty sell, for\r\nfilthy lucre, the knack and the skill with which she made trifles of\r\nvalue to those who loved her?",
    "I had to come down to reading, writing, and arithmetic; and, in reading\r\nthe",
    "morning, she always coughed before coming to long\r\nwords.  I doubted her power of getting through a genealogical chapter,\r\nwith any number of coughs.  Writing she did well and delicately-but\r\nspelling!  She seemed to think that the more out-of-the-way this was,\r\nand the more trouble it cost her, the greater the compliment she paid to\r\nher correspondent; and words that she would spell quite correctly in her\r\nletters to me became perfect enigmas when she wrote to my father.",
    "No! there was nothing she could teach to the rising generation of\r\nCranford, unless they had been quick learners and ready imitators of her\r\npatience, her humility, her sweetness, her quiet contentment with all\r\nthat she could not do.  I pondered and pondered until dinner was\r\nannounced by Martha, with a face all blubbered and swollen with crying.",
    "Miss Matty had a few little peculiarities which Martha was apt to regard\r\nas whims below her attention, and appeared to consider as childish\r\nfancies of which an old lady of fifty-eight should try and cure herself.\r\nBut to-day everything was attended to with the most careful regard.  The\r\nbread was cut to the imaginary pattern of excellence that existed in\r\nMiss Matty's mind, as being the way which her mother had preferred, the\r\ncurtain was drawn so as to exclude the dead brick wall of a neighbour's\r\nstable, and yet left so as to show every tender leaf of the poplar which\r\nwas bursting into spring beauty.  Martha's tone to Miss Matty was just\r\nsuch as that good, rough-spoken servant usually kept sacred for little\r\nchildren, and which I had never heard her use to any grown-up person.",
    "I had forgotten to tell Miss Matty about the pudding, and I was afraid\r\nshe might not do justice to it, for she had evidently very little\r\nappetite this day; so I seized the opportunity of letting her into the\r\nsecret while Martha took away the meat.  Miss Matty's eyes filled with\r\ntears, and she could not speak, either to express surprise or delight,\r\nwhen Martha returned bearing it aloft, made in the most wonderful\r\nrepresentation of a lion _couchant_ that ever was moulded.  Martha's\r\nface gleamed with triumph as she set it down before Miss Matty with an\r\nexultant \"There!\"  Miss Matty wanted to speak her thanks, but could not;\r\nso she took Martha's hand and shook it warmly, which set Martha off\r\ncrying, and I myself could hardly keep up the necessary composure.\r\nMartha burst out of the room, and Miss Matty had to clear her voice once\r\nor twice before she could speak.  At last she said, \"I should like to\r\nkeep this pudding under a glass shade, my dear!\" and the notion of the\r\nlion _couchant_, with his currant eyes, being hoisted up to the place of\r\nhonour on a mantelpiece, tickled my hysterical fancy, and I began to\r\nlaugh, which rather surprised Miss Matty.",
    "\"I am sure, dear, I have seen uglier things under a glass shade before\r\nnow,\" said she.",
    "So had I, many a time and oft, and I accordingly composed my countenance\r\n(and now I could hardly keep from crying), and we both fell to upon the\r\npudding, which was indeed excellent-only every morsel seemed to choke\r\nus, our hearts were so full.",
    "We had too much to think about to talk much that afternoon.  It passed\r\nover very tranquilly.  But when the tea-urn was brought in a new thought\r\ncame into my head.  Why should not Miss Matty sell tea-be an agent to\r\nthe East India Tea Company which then existed?  I could see no\r\nobjections to this plan, while the advantages were many-always supposing\r\nthat Miss Matty could get over the degradation of condescending to\r\nanything like trade.  Tea was neither greasy nor sticky-grease and\r\nstickiness being two of the qualities which Miss Matty could not endure.\r\n No shop-window would be required.  A small, genteel notification of her\r\nbeing licensed to sell tea would, it is true, be necessary, but I hoped\r\nthat it could be placed where no one would see it.  Neither was tea a\r\nheavy article, so as to tax Miss Matty's fragile strength.  The only\r\nthing against my plan was the buying and selling involved.",
    "While I was giving but absent answers to the questions Miss Matty was\r\nputting-almost as absently-we heard a clumping sound on the stairs, and\r\na whispering outside the door, which indeed once opened and shut as if\r\nby some invisible agency.  After a little while Martha came in, dragging\r\nafter her a great tall young man, all crimson with shyness, and finding\r\nhis only relief in perpetually sleeking down his hair.",
    "\"Please, ma'am, he's only Jem Hearn,\" said Martha, by way of an\r\nintroduction; and so out of breath was she that I imagine she had had\r\nsome bodily struggle before she could overcome his reluctance to be\r\npresented on the courtly scene of Miss Matilda Jenkyns's drawing-room.",
    "\"And please, ma'am, he wants to marry me off-hand.  And please, ma'am,\r\nwe want to take a lodger-just one quiet lodger, to make our two ends\r\nmeet; and we'd take any house conformable; and, oh dear Miss Matty, if I\r\nmay be so bold, would you have any objections to lodging with us?  Jem\r\nwants it as much as I do.\"  [To Jem ]-\"You great oaf! why can't you back\r\nme!-But he does want it all the same, very bad-don't you, Jem?-only, you\r\nsee, he's dazed at being called on to speak before quality.\"",
    "[Picture: Please, ma'am, he wants to marry me off-hand]",
    "\"It's not that,\" broke in Jem.  \"It's that you've taken me all on a\r\nsudden, and I didn't think for to get married so soon-and such quick\r\nwords does flabbergast a man.  It's not that I'm against it, ma'am\"\r\n(addressing Miss Matty), \"only Martha has such quick ways with her when\r\nonce she takes a thing into her head; and marriage, ma'am-marriage nails\r\na man, as one may say.  I dare say I shan't mind it after it's once\r\nover.\"",
    "\"Please, ma'am,\" said Martha-who had plucked at his sleeve, and nudged\r\nhim with her elbow, and otherwise tried to interrupt him all the time\r\nhe had been speaking-\"don't mind him, he'll come to; 'twas only last\r\nnight he was an-axing me, and an-axing me, and all the more because I\r\nsaid I could not think of it for years to come, and now he's only taken\r\naback with the suddenness of the joy; but you know, Jem, you are just as\r\nfull as me about wanting a lodger.\"  (Another great nudge.)",
    "\"Ay! if Miss Matty would lodge with us-otherwise I've no mind to be\r\ncumbered with strange folk in the house,\" said Jem, with a want of tact\r\nwhich I could see enraged Martha, who was trying to represent a lodger\r\nas the great object they wished to obtain, and that, in fact, Miss Matty\r\nwould be smoothing their path and conferring a favour, if she would only\r\ncome and live with them.",
    "Miss Matty herself was bewildered by the pair; their, or rather Martha's\r\nsudden resolution in favour of matrimony staggered her, and stood\r\nbetween her and the contemplation of the plan which Martha had at heart.\r\n Miss Matty began-",
    "\"Marriage is a very solemn thing, Martha.\"",
    "\"It is indeed, ma'am,\" quoth Jem.  \"Not that I've no objections to\r\nMartha.\"",
    "\"You've never let me a-be for asking me for to fix when I would be\r\nmarried,\" said Martha-her face all a-fire, and ready to cry with\r\nvexation-\"and now you're shaming me before my missus and all.\"",
    "\"Nay, now!  Martha don't ee! don't ee! only a man likes to have\r\nbreathing-time,\" said Jem, trying to possess himself of her hand, but in\r\nvain.  Then seeing that she was more seriously hurt than he had\r\nimagined, he seemed to try to rally his scattered faculties, and with\r\nmore straightforward dignity than, ten minutes before, I should have\r\nthought it possible for him to assume, he turned to Miss Matty, and\r\nsaid, \"I hope, ma'am, you know that I am bound to respect every one who\r\nhas been kind to Martha.  I always looked on her as to be my wife-some\r\ntime; and she has often and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that\r\never was; and though the plain truth is, I would not like to be troubled\r\nwith lodgers of the common run, yet if, ma'am, you'd honour us by living\r\nwith us, I'm sure Martha would do her best to make you comfortable; and\r\nI'd keep out of your way as much as I could, which I reckon would be the\r\nbest kindness such an awkward chap as me could do.\"",
    "Miss Matty had been very busy with taking off her spectacles, wiping\r\nthem, and replacing them; but all she could say was, \"Don't let any\r\nthought of me hurry you into marriage: pray don't.  Marriage is such a\r\nvery solemn thing!\"",
    "\"But Miss Matilda will think of your plan, Martha,\" said I, struck with\r\nthe advantages that it offered, and unwilling to lose the opportunity of\r\nconsidering about it.  \"And I'm sure neither she nor I can ever forget\r\nyour kindness; nor yours either, Jem.\"",
    "\"Why, yes, ma'am!  I'm sure I mean kindly, though I'm a bit fluttered by\r\nbeing pushed straight ahead into matrimony, as it were, and mayn't\r\nexpress myself conformable.  But I'm sure I'm willing enough, and give\r\nme time to get accustomed; so, Martha, wench, what's the use of crying\r\nso, and slapping me if I come near?\"",
    "This last was _sotto voce_, and had the effect of making Martha bounce\r\nout of the room, to be followed and soothed by her lover.  Whereupon\r\nMiss Matty sat down and cried very heartily, and accounted for it by\r\nsaying that the thought of Martha being married so soon gave her quite a\r\nshock, and that she should never forgive herself if she thought she was\r\nhurrying the poor creature.  I think my pity was more for Jem, of the\r\ntwo; but both Miss Matty and I appreciated to the full the kindness of\r\nthe honest couple, although we said little about this, and a good deal\r\nabout the chances and dangers of matrimony.",
    "The next morning, very early, I received a note from Miss Pole, so\r\nmysteriously wrapped up, and with so many seals on it to secure secrecy,\r\nthat I had to tear the paper before I could unfold it.  And when I came\r\nto the writing I could hardly understand the meaning, it was so involved\r\nand oracular.  I made out, however, that I was to go to Miss Pole's at\r\neleven o'clock; the number _eleven_ being written in full length as well\r\nas in numerals, and _A.M._ twice dashed under, as if I were very likely\r\nto come at eleven at night, when all Cranford was usually abed and\r\nasleep by ten.  There was no signature except Miss Pole's initials\r\nreversed, P.E.; but as Martha had given me the note, \"with Miss Pole's\r\nkind regards,\" it needed no wizard to find out who sent it; and if the\r\nwriter's name was to be kept secret, it was very well that I was alone\r\nwhen Martha delivered it.",
    "I went as requested to Miss Pole's.  The door was opened to me by her\r\nlittle maid Lizzy in Sunday trim, as if some grand event was impending\r\nover this work-day.  And the drawing-room upstairs was arranged in\r\naccordance with this idea.  The table was set out with the best green\r\ncard-cloth, and writing materials upon it.  On the little chiffonier was\r\na tray with a newly-decanted bottle of cowslip wine, and some\r\nladies'-finger biscuits.  Miss Pole herself was in solemn array, as if\r\nto receive visitors, although it was only eleven o'clock.  Mrs Forrester\r\nwas there, crying quietly and sadly, and my arrival seemed only to call\r\nforth fresh tears.  Before we had finished our greetings, performed with\r\nlugubrious mystery of demeanour, there was another rat-tat-tat, and Mrs\r\nFitz-Adam appeared, crimson with walking and excitement.  It seemed as\r\nif this was all the company expected; for now Miss Pole made several\r\ndemonstrations of being about to open the business of the meeting, by\r\nstirring the fire, opening and shutting the door, and coughing and\r\nblowing her nose.  Then she arranged us all round the table, taking care\r\nto place me opposite to her; and last of all, she inquired of me if the\r\nsad report was true, as she feared it was, that Miss Matty had lost all\r\nher fortune?",
    "Of course, I had but one answer to make; and I never saw more unaffected\r\nsorrow depicted on any countenances than I did there on the three before\r\nme.",
    "\"I wish Mrs Jamieson was here!\" said Mrs Forrester at last; but to judge\r\nfrom Mrs Fitz-Adam's face, she could not second the wish.",
    "\"But without Mrs Jamieson,\" said Miss Pole, with just a sound of\r\noffended merit in her voice, \"we, the ladies of Cranford, in my\r\ndrawing-room assembled, can resolve upon something.  I imagine we are\r\nnone of us what may be called rich, though we all possess a genteel\r\ncompetency, sufficient for tastes that are elegant and refined, and\r\nwould not, if they could, be vulgarly ostentatious.\"  (Here I observed\r\nMiss Pole refer to a small card concealed in her hand, on which I\r\nimagine she had put down a few notes.)",
    "\"Miss Smith,\" she continued, addressing me (familiarly known as \"Mary\"\r\nto all the company assembled, but this was a state occasion), \"I have\r\nconversed in private-I made it my business to do so yesterday\r\nafternoon-with these ladies on the misfortune which has happened to our\r\nfriend, and one and all of us have agreed that while we have a\r\nsuperfluity, it is not only a duty, but a pleasure-a true pleasure,\r\nMary!\"-her voice was rather choked just here, and she had to wipe her\r\nspectacles before she could go on-\"to give what we can to assist\r\nher-Miss Matilda Jenkyns.  Only in consideration of the feelings of\r\ndelicate independence existing in the mind of every refined female\"-I\r\nwas sure she had got back to the card now-\"we wish to contribute our\r\nmites in a secret and concealed manner, so as not to hurt the feelings I\r\nhave referred to. And our object in requesting you to meet us this\r\nmorning is that, believing you are the daughter-that your father is, in\r\nfact, her confidential adviser, in all pecuniary matters, we imagined\r\nthat, by consulting with him, you might devise some mode in which our\r\ncontribution could be made to appear the legal due which Miss Matilda\r\nJenkyns ought to receive from-  Probably your father, knowing her\r\ninvestments, can fill up the blank.\"",
    "Miss Pole concluded her address, and looked round for approval and\r\nagreement.",
    "\"I have expressed your meaning, ladies, have I not?  And while Miss\r\nSmith considers what reply to make, allow me to offer you some little\r\nrefreshment.\"",
    "I had no great reply to make: I had more thankfulness at my heart for\r\ntheir kind thoughts than I cared to put into words; and so I only\r\nmumbled out something to the effect \"that I would name what Miss Pole\r\nhad said to my father, and that if anything could be arranged for dear\r\nMiss Matty,\"-and here I broke down utterly, and had to be refreshed with\r\na glass of cowslip wine before I could check the crying which had been\r\nrepressed for the last two or three days.  The worst was, all the ladies\r\ncried in concert.  Even Miss Pole cried, who had said a hundred times\r\nthat to betray emotion before any one was a sign of weakness and want of\r\nself-control.  She recovered herself into a slight degree of impatient\r\nanger, directed against me, as having set them all off; and, moreover, I\r\nthink she was vexed that I could not make a speech back in return for\r\nhers; and if I had known beforehand what was to be said, and had a card\r\non which to express the probable feelings that would rise in my heart, I\r\nwould have tried to gratify her.  As it was, Mrs Forrester was the\r\nperson to speak when we had recovered our composure.",
    "\"I don't mind, among friends, stating that I-no!  I'm not poor exactly,\r\nbut I don't think I'm what you may call rich; I wish I were, for dear\r\nMiss Matty's sake-but, if you please, I'll write down in a sealed paper\r\nwhat I can give.  I only wish it was more; my dear Mary, I do indeed.\"",
    "Now I saw why paper, pens, and ink were provided.  Every lady wrote down\r\nthe sum she could give annually, signed the paper, and sealed it\r\nmysteriously.  If their proposal was acceded to, my father was to be\r\nallowed to open the papers, under pledge of secrecy.  If not, they were\r\nto be returned to their writers.",
    "When the ceremony had been gone through, I rose to depart; but each lady\r\nseemed to wish to have a private conference with me.  Miss Pole kept me\r\nin the drawing-room to explain why, in Mrs Jamieson's absence, she had\r\ntaken the lead in this \"movement,\" as she was pleased to call it, and\r\nalso to inform me that she had heard from good sources that Mrs Jamieson\r\nwas coming home directly in a state of high displeasure against her\r\nsister-in-law, who was forthwith to leave her house, and was, she\r\nbelieved, to return to Edinburgh that very afternoon.  Of course this\r\npiece of intelligence could not be communicated before Mrs Fitz-Adam,\r\nmore especially as Miss Pole was inclined to think that Lady Glenmire's\r\nengagement to Mr Hoggins could not possibly hold against the blaze of\r\nMrs Jamieson's displeasure.  A few hearty inquiries after Miss Matty's\r\nhealth concluded my interview with Miss Pole.",
    "On coming downstairs I found Mrs Forrester waiting for me at the\r\nentrance to the dining-parlour; she drew me in, and when the door was\r\nshut, she tried two or three times to begin on some subject, which was\r\nso unapproachable apparently, that I began to despair of our ever\r\ngetting to a clear understanding.  At last out it came; the poor old\r\nlady trembling all the time as if it were a great crime which she was\r\nexposing to daylight, in telling me how very, very little she had to\r\nlive upon; a confession which she was brought to make from a dread lest\r\nwe should think that the small contribution named in her paper bore any\r\nproportion to her love and regard for Miss Matty.  And yet that sum\r\nwhich she so eagerly relinquished was, in truth, more than a twentieth\r\npart of what she had to live upon, and keep house, and a little\r\nserving-maid, all as became one born a Tyrrell.  And when the whole\r\nincome does not nearly amount to a hundred pounds, to give up a\r\ntwentieth of it will necessitate many careful economies, and many pieces\r\nof self-denial, small and insignificant in the world's account, but\r\nbearing a different value in another account-book that I have heard of.\r\nShe did so wish she was rich, she said, and this wish she kept\r\nrepeating, with no thought of herself in it, only with a longing,\r\nyearning desire to be able to heap up Miss Matty's measure of comforts.",
    "It was some time before I could console her enough to leave her; and\r\nthen, on quitting the house, I was waylaid by Mrs Fitz-Adam, who had\r\nalso her confidence to make of pretty nearly the opposite description.\r\nShe had not liked to put down all that she could afford and was ready to\r\ngive.  She told me she thought she never could look Miss Matty in the\r\nface again if she presumed to be giving her so much as she should like\r\nto do.  \"Miss Matty!\" continued she, \"that I thought was such a fine\r\nyoung lady when I was nothing but a country girl, coming to market with\r\neggs and butter and such like things.  For my father, though well-to-do,\r\nwould always make me go on as my mother had done before me, and I had to\r\ncome into Cranford every Saturday, and see after sales, and prices, and\r\nwhat not.  And one day, I remember, I met Miss Matty in the lane that\r\nleads to Combehurst; she was walking on the footpath, which, you know,\r\nis raised a good way above the road, and a gentleman rode beside her,\r\nand was talking to her, and she was looking down at some primroses she\r\nhad gathered, and pulling them all to pieces, and I do believe she was\r\ncrying.  But after she had passed, she turned round and ran after me to\r\nask-oh, so kindly-about my poor mother, who lay on her death-bed; and\r\nwhen I cried she took hold of my hand to comfort me-and the gentleman\r\nwaiting for her all the time-and her poor heart very full of something,\r\nI am sure; and I thought it such an honour to be spoken to in that\r\npretty way by the rector's daughter, who visited at Arley Hall.  I have\r\nloved her ever since, though perhaps I'd no right to do it; but if you\r\ncan think of any way in which I might be allowed to give a little more\r\nwithout any one knowing it, I should be so much obliged to you, my dear.\r\n And my brother would be delighted to doctor her for nothing-medicines,\r\nleeches, and all. I know that he and her ladyship (my dear, I little\r\nthought in the days I was telling you of that I should ever come to be\r\nsister-in-law to a ladyship!) would do anything for her.  We all would.\"",
    "I told her I was quite sure of it, and promised all sorts of things in\r\nmy anxiety to get home to Miss Matty, who might well be wondering what\r\nhad become of me-absent from her two hours without being able to account\r\nfor it.  She had taken very little note of time, however, as she had\r\nbeen occupied in numberless little arrangements preparatory to the great\r\nstep of giving up her house.  It was evidently a relief to her to be\r\ndoing something in the way of retrenchment, for, as she said, whenever\r\nshe paused to think, the recollection of the poor fellow with his bad\r\nfive-pound note came over her, and she felt quite dishonest; only if it\r\nmade her so uncomfortable, what must it not be doing to the directors of\r\nthe bank, who must know so much more of the misery consequent upon this\r\nfailure?  She almost made me angry by dividing her sympathy between\r\nthese directors (whom she imagined overwhelmed by self-reproach for the\r\nmismanagement of other people's affairs) and those who were suffering\r\nlike her.  Indeed, of the two, she seemed to think poverty a lighter\r\nburden than self-reproach; but I privately doubted if the directors\r\nwould agree with her.",
    "Old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value which\r\nluckily was small, or else I don't know how Miss Matty would have\r\nprevailed upon herself to part with such things as her mother's\r\nwedding-ring, the strange, uncouth brooch with which her father had\r\ndisfigured his shirt-frill, &c.  However, we arranged things a little in\r\norder as to their pecuniary estimation, and were all ready for my father\r\nwhen he came the next morning.",
    "I am not going to weary you with the details of all the business we went\r\nthrough; and one reason for not telling about them is, that I did not\r\nunderstand what we were doing at the time, and cannot recollect it now.\r\nMiss Matty and I sat assenting to accounts, and schemes, and reports,\r\nand documents, of which I do not believe we either of us understood a\r\nword; for my father was clear-headed and decisive, and a capital man of\r\nbusiness, and if we made the slightest inquiry, or expressed the\r\nslightest want of comprehension, he had a sharp way of saying, \"Eh? eh?\r\nit's as clear as daylight.  What's your objection?\"  And as we had not\r\ncomprehended anything of what he had proposed, we found it rather\r\ndifficult to shape our objections; in fact, we never were sure if we had\r\nany.  So presently Miss Matty got into a nervously acquiescent state,\r\nand said \"Yes,\" and \"Certainly,\" at every pause, whether required or\r\nnot; but when I once joined in as chorus to a \"Decidedly,\" pronounced by\r\nMiss Matty in a tremblingly dubious tone, my father fired round at me\r\nand asked me \"What there was to decide?\"  And I am sure to this day I\r\nhave never known.  But, in justice to him, I must say he had come over\r\nfrom Drumble to help Miss Matty when he could ill spare the time, and\r\nwhen his own affairs were in a very anxious state.",
    "[Picture: Miss Matty and I sat assenting to accounts]",
    "While Miss Matty was out of the room giving orders for luncheon-and\r\nsadly perplexed between her desire of honouring my father by a delicate,\r\ndainty meal, and her conviction that she had no right, now that all her\r\nmoney was gone, to indulge this desire-I told him of the meeting of the\r\nCranford ladies at Miss Pole's the day before.  He kept brushing his\r\nhand before his eyes as I spoke-and when I went back to Martha's offer\r\nthe evening before, of receiving Miss Matty as a lodger, he fairly\r\nwalked away from me to the window, and began drumming with his fingers\r\nupon it. Then he turned abruptly round, and said, \"See, Mary, how a\r\ngood, innocent life makes friends all around.  Confound it!  I could\r\nmake a good lesson out of it if I were a parson; but, as it is, I can't\r\nget a tail to my sentences-only I'm sure you feel what I want to say.\r\nYou and I will have a walk after lunch and talk a bit more about these\r\nplans.\"",
    "The lunch-a hot savoury mutton-chop, and a little of the cold loin\r\nsliced and fried-was now brought in.  Every morsel of this last dish was\r\nfinished, to Martha's great gratification.  Then my father bluntly told\r\nMiss Matty he wanted to talk to me alone, and that he would stroll out\r\nand see some of the old places, and then I could tell her what plan we\r\nthought desirable.  Just before we went out, she called me back and\r\nsaid, \"Remember, dear, I'm the only one left-I mean, there's no one to\r\nbe hurt by what I do.  I'm willing to do anything that's right and\r\nhonest; and I don't think, if Deborah knows where she is, she'll care so\r\nvery much if I'm not genteel; because, you see, she'll know all, dear.\r\nOnly let me see what I can do, and pay the poor people as far as I'm\r\nable.\"",
    "I gave her a hearty kiss, and ran after my father.  The result of our\r\nconversation was this.  If all parties were agreeable, Martha and Jem\r\nwere to be married with as little delay as possible, and they were to\r\nlive on in Miss Matty's present abode; the sum which the Cranford ladies\r\nhad agreed to contribute annually being sufficient to meet the greater\r\npart of the rent, and leaving Martha free to appropriate what Miss Matty\r\nshould pay for her lodgings to any little extra comforts required.\r\nAbout the sale, my father was dubious at first.  He said the old rectory\r\nfurniture, however carefully used and reverently treated, would fetch\r\nvery little; and that little would be but as a drop in the sea of the\r\ndebts of the Town and County Bank.  But when I represented how Miss\r\nMatty's tender conscience would be soothed by feeling that she had done\r\nwhat she could, he gave way; especially after I had told him the\r\nfive-pound note adventure, and he had scolded me well for allowing it.\r\nI then alluded to my idea that she might add to her small income by\r\nselling tea; and, to my surprise (for I had nearly given up the plan),\r\nmy father grasped at it with all the energy of a tradesman.  I think he\r\nreckoned his chickens before they were hatched, for he immediately ran\r\nup the profits of the sales that she could effect in Cranford to more\r\nthan twenty pounds a year.  The small dining-parlour was to be converted\r\ninto a shop, without any of its degrading characteristics; a table was\r\nto be the counter; one window was to be retained unaltered, and the\r\nother changed into a glass door.  I evidently rose in his estimation for\r\nhaving made this bright suggestion.  I only hoped we should not both\r\nfall in Miss Matty's.",
    "But she was patient and content with all our arrangements.  She knew,\r\nshe said, that we should do the best we could for her; and she only\r\nhoped, only stipulated, that she should pay every farthing that she\r\ncould be said to owe, for her father's sake, who had been so respected\r\nin Cranford.  My father and I had agreed to say as little as possible\r\nabout the bank, indeed never to mention it again, if it could be helped.\r\n Some of the plans were evidently a little perplexing to her; but she\r\nhad seen me sufficiently snubbed in the morning for want of\r\ncomprehension to venture on too many inquiries now; and all passed over\r\nwell with a hope on her part that no one would be hurried into marriage\r\non her account. When we came to the proposal that she should sell tea, I\r\ncould see it was rather a shock to her; not on account of any personal\r\nloss of gentility involved, but only because she distrusted her own\r\npowers of action in a new line of life, and would timidly have preferred\r\na little more privation to any exertion for which she feared she was\r\nunfitted. However, when she saw my father was bent upon it, she sighed,\r\nand said she would try; and if she did not do well, of course she might\r\ngive it up.  One good thing about it was, she did not think men ever\r\nbought tea; and it was of men particularly she was afraid.  They had\r\nsuch sharp loud ways with them; and did up accounts, and counted their\r\nchange so quickly! Now, if she might only sell comfits to children, she\r\nwas sure she could please them!",
    ".\r\nA HAPPY RETURN",
    "BEFORE I left Miss Matty at Cranford everything had been comfortably\r\narranged for her.  Even Mrs Jamieson's approval of her selling tea had\r\nbeen gained.  That oracle had taken a few days to consider whether by so\r\ndoing Miss Matty would forfeit her right to the privileges of society in\r\nCranford.  I think she had some little idea of mortifying Lady Glenmire\r\nby the decision she gave at last; which was to this effect: that whereas\r\na married woman takes her husband's rank by the strict laws of\r\nprecedence, an unmarried woman retains the station her father occupied.\r\nSo Cranford was allowed to visit Miss Matty; and, whether allowed or\r\nnot, it intended to visit Lady Glenmire.",
    "But what was our surprise-our dismay-when we learnt that Mr and _Mrs\r\nHoggins_ were returning on the following Tuesday!  Mrs Hoggins!  Had\r\nshe absolutely dropped her title, and so, in a spirit of bravado, cut\r\nthe aristocracy to become a Hoggins!  She, who might have been called\r\nLady Glenmire to her dying day!  Mrs Jamieson was pleased.  She said it\r\nonly convinced her of what she had known from the first, that the\r\ncreature had a low taste.  But \"the creature\" looked very happy on\r\nSunday at church; nor did we see it necessary to keep our veils down on\r\nthat side of our bonnets on which Mr and Mrs Hoggins sat, as Mrs\r\nJamieson did; thereby missing all the smiling glory of his face, and all\r\nthe becoming blushes of hers.  I am not sure if Martha and Jem looked\r\nmore radiant in the afternoon, when they, too, made their first\r\nappearance.  Mrs Jamieson soothed the turbulence of her soul by having\r\nthe blinds of her windows drawn down, as if for a funeral, on the day\r\nwhen Mr and Mrs Hoggins received callers; and it was with some\r\ndifficulty that she was prevailed upon to continue the _St James's\r\nChronicle_, so indignant was she with its having inserted the\r\nannouncement of the marriage.",
    "[Picture: Smiling glory ... and becoming blushes]",
    "Miss Matty's sale went off famously.  She retained the furniture of her\r\nsitting-room and bedroom; the former of which she was to occupy till\r\nMartha could meet with a lodger who might wish to take it; and into this\r\nsitting-room and bedroom she had to cram all sorts of things, which were\r\n(the auctioneer assured her) bought in for her at the sale by an unknown\r\nfriend.  I always suspected Mrs Fitz-Adam of this; but she must have had\r\nan accessory, who knew what articles were particularly regarded by Miss\r\nMatty on account of their associations with her early days.  The rest of\r\nthe house looked rather bare, to be sure; all except one tiny bedroom,\r\nof which my father allowed me to purchase the furniture for my\r\noccasional use in case of Miss Matty's illness.",
    "I had expended my own small store in buying all manner of comfits and\r\nlozenges, in order to tempt the little people whom Miss Matty loved so\r\nmuch to come about her.  Tea in bright green canisters, and comfits in\r\ntumblers-Miss Matty and I felt quite proud as we looked round us on the\r\nevening before the shop was to be opened.  Martha had scoured the\r\nboarded floor to a white cleanness, and it was adorned with a brilliant\r\npiece of oil-cloth, on which customers were to stand before the\r\ntable-counter. The wholesome smell of plaster and whitewash pervaded the\r\napartment.  A very small \"Matilda Jenkyns, licensed to sell tea,\" was\r\nhidden under the lintel of the new door, and two boxes of tea, with\r\ncabalistic inscriptions all over them, stood ready to disgorge their\r\ncontents into the canisters.",
    "Miss Matty, as I ought to have mentioned before, had had some scruples\r\nof conscience at selling tea when there was already Mr Johnson in the\r\ntown, who included it among his numerous commodities; and, before she\r\ncould quite reconcile herself to the adoption of her new business, she\r\nhad trotted down to his shop, unknown to me, to tell him of the project\r\nthat was entertained, and to inquire if it was likely to injure his\r\nbusiness. My father called this idea of hers \"great nonsense,\" and\r\n\"wondered how tradespeople were to get on if there was to be a continual\r\nconsulting of each other's interests, which would put a stop to all\r\ncompetition directly.\"  And, perhaps, it would not have done in Drumble,\r\nbut in Cranford it answered very well; for not only did Mr Johnson\r\nkindly put at rest all Miss Matty's scruples and fear of injuring his\r\nbusiness, but I have reason to know he repeatedly sent customers to her,\r\nsaying that the teas he kept were of a common kind, but that Miss\r\nJenkyns had all the choice sorts.  And expensive tea is a very favourite\r\nluxury with well-to-do tradespeople and rich farmers' wives, who turn up\r\ntheir noses at the Congou and Souchong prevalent at many tables of\r\ngentility, and will have nothing else than Gunpowder and Pekoe for\r\nthemselves.",
    "But to return to Miss Matty.  It was really very pleasant to see how her\r\nunselfishness and simple sense of justice called out the same good\r\nqualities in others.  She never seemed to think any one would impose\r\nupon her, because she should be so grieved to do it to them.  I have\r\nheard her put a stop to the asseverations of the man who brought her\r\ncoals by quietly saying, \"I am sure you would be sorry to bring me wrong\r\nweight;\" and if the coals were short measure that time, I don't believe\r\nthey ever were again.  People would have felt as much ashamed of\r\npresuming on her good faith as they would have done on that of a child.\r\nBut my father says \"such simplicity might be very well in Cranford, but\r\nwould never do in the world.\"  And I fancy the world must be very bad,\r\nfor with all my father's suspicion of every one with whom he has\r\ndealings, and in spite of all his many precautions, he lost upwards of a\r\nthousand pounds by roguery only last year.",
    "I just stayed long enough to establish Miss Matty in her new mode of\r\nlife, and to pack up the library, which the rector had purchased.  He\r\nhad written a very kind letter to Miss Matty, saying \"how glad he should\r\nbe to take a library, so well selected as he knew that the late Mr\r\nJenkyns's must have been, at any valuation put upon them.\"  And when she\r\nagreed to this, with a touch of sorrowful gladness that they would go\r\nback to the rectory and be arranged on the accustomed walls once more,\r\nhe sent word that he feared that he had not room for them all, and\r\nperhaps Miss Matty would kindly allow him to leave some volumes on her\r\nshelves.  But Miss Matty said that she had her Bible and \"Johnson's\r\nDictionary,\" and should not have much time for reading, she was afraid;\r\nstill, I retained a few books out of consideration for the rector's\r\nkindness.",
    "The money which he had paid, and that produced by the sale, was partly\r\nexpended in the stock of tea, and part of it was invested against a\r\nrainy day-_i.e._ old age or illness.  It was but a small sum, it is\r\ntrue; and it occasioned a few evasions of truth and white lies (all of\r\nwhich I think very wrong indeed-in theory-and would rather not put them\r\nin practice), for we knew Miss Matty would be perplexed as to her duty\r\nif she were aware of any little reserve-fund being made for her while\r\nthe debts of the bank remained unpaid.  Moreover, she had never been\r\ntold of the way in which her friends were contributing to pay the rent.\r\nI should have liked to tell her this, but the mystery of the affair gave\r\na piquancy to their deed of kindness which the ladies were unwilling to\r\ngive up; and at first Martha had to shirk many a perplexed question as\r\nto her ways and means of living in such a house, but by-and-by Miss\r\nMatty's prudent uneasiness sank down into acquiescence with the existing\r\narrangement.",
    "I left Miss Matty with a good heart.  Her sales of tea during the first\r\ntwo days had surpassed my most sanguine expectations.  The whole country\r\nround seemed to be all out of tea at once.  The only alteration I could\r\nhave desired in Miss Matty's way of doing business was, that she should\r\nnot have so plaintively entreated some of her customers not to buy green\r\ntea-running it down as a slow poison, sure to destroy the nerves, and\r\nproduce all manner of evil.  Their pertinacity in taking it, in spite of\r\nall her warnings, distressed her so much that I really thought she would\r\nrelinquish the sale of it, and so lose half her custom; and I was driven\r\nto my wits' end for instances of longevity entirely attributable to a\r\npersevering use of green tea.  But the final argument, which settled the\r\nquestion, was a happy reference of mine to the train-oil and tallow\r\ncandles which the Esquimaux not only enjoy but digest.  After that she\r\nacknowledged that \"one man's meat might be another man's poison,\" and\r\ncontented herself thence-forward with an occasional remonstrance when\r\nshe thought the purchaser was too young and innocent to be acquainted\r\nwith the evil effects green tea produced on some constitutions, and an\r\nhabitual sigh when people old enough to choose more wisely would prefer\r\nit.",
    "I went over from Drumble once a quarter at least to settle the accounts,\r\nand see after the necessary business letters.  And, speaking of letters,\r\nI began to be very much ashamed of remembering my letter to the Aga\r\nJenkyns, and very glad I had never named my writing to any one.  I only\r\nhoped the letter was lost.  No answer came.  No sign was made.",
    "About a year after Miss Matty set up shop, I received one of Martha's\r\nhieroglyphics, begging me to come to Cranford very soon.  I was afraid\r\nthat Miss Matty was ill, and went off that very afternoon, and took\r\nMartha by surprise when she saw me on opening the door.  We went into\r\nthe kitchen as usual, to have our confidential conference, and then\r\nMartha told me she was expecting her confinement very soon-in a week or\r\ntwo; and she did not think Miss Matty was aware of it, and she wanted me\r\nto break the news to her, \"for indeed, miss,\" continued Martha, crying\r\nhysterically, \"I'm afraid she won't approve of it, and I'm sure I don't\r\nknow who is to take care of her as she should be taken care of when I am\r\nlaid up.\"",
    "I comforted Martha by telling her I would remain till she was about\r\nagain, and only wished she had told me her reason for this sudden\r\nsummons, as then I would have brought the requisite stock of clothes.\r\nBut Martha was so tearful and tender-spirited, and unlike her usual\r\nself, that I said as little as possible about myself, and endeavoured\r\nrather to comfort Martha under all the probable and possible misfortunes\r\nwhich came crowding upon her imagination.",
    "I then stole out of the house-door, and made my appearance as if I were\r\na customer in the shop, just to take Miss Matty by surprise, and gain an\r\nidea of how she looked in her new situation.  It was warm May weather,\r\nso only the little half-door was closed; and Miss Matty sat behind the\r\ncounter, knitting an elaborate pair of garters; elaborate they seemed to\r\nme, but the difficult stitch was no weight upon her mind, for she was\r\nsinging in a low voice to herself as her needles went rapidly in and\r\nout. I call it singing, but I dare say a musician would not use that\r\nword to the tuneless yet sweet humming of the low worn voice.  I found\r\nout from the words, far more than from the attempt at the tune, that it\r\nwas the Old Hundredth she was crooning to herself; but the quiet\r\ncontinuous sound told of content, and gave me a pleasant feeling, as I\r\nstood in the street just outside the door, quite in harmony with that\r\nsoft May morning.  I went in.  At first she did not catch who it was,\r\nand stood up as if to serve me; but in another minute watchful pussy had\r\nclutched her knitting, which was dropped in eager joy at seeing me.  I\r\nfound, after we had had a little conversation, that it was as Martha\r\nsaid, and that Miss Matty had no idea of the approaching household\r\nevent.  So I thought I would let things take their course, secure that\r\nwhen I went to her with the baby in my arms, I should obtain that\r\nforgiveness for Martha which she was needlessly frightening herself into\r\nbelieving that Miss Matty would withhold, under some notion that the new\r\nclaimant would require attentions from its mother that it would be\r\nfaithless treason to Miss Matty to render.",
    "But I was right.  I think that must be an hereditary quality, for my\r\nfather says he is scarcely ever wrong.  One morning, within a week after\r\nI arrived, I went to call Miss Matty, with a little bundle of flannel in\r\nmy arms.  She was very much awestruck when I showed her what it was, and\r\nasked for her spectacles off the dressing-table, and looked at it\r\ncuriously, with a sort of tender wonder at its small perfection of\r\nparts. She could not banish the thought of the surprise all day, but\r\nwent about on tiptoe, and was very silent.  But she stole up to see\r\nMartha and they both cried with joy, and she got into a complimentary\r\nspeech to Jem, and did not know how to get out of it again, and was only\r\nextricated from her dilemma by the sound of the shop-bell, which was an\r\nequal relief to the shy, proud, honest Jem, who shook my hand so\r\nvigorously when I congratulated him, that I think I feel the pain of it\r\nyet.",
    "[Picture: I went to call Miss Matty]",
    "I had a busy life while Martha was laid up.  I attended on Miss Matty,\r\nand prepared her meals; I cast up her accounts, and examined into the\r\nstate of her canisters and tumblers.  I helped her, too, occasionally,\r\nin the shop; and it gave me no small amusement, and sometimes a little\r\nuneasiness, to watch her ways there.  If a little child came in to ask\r\nfor an ounce of almond-comfits (and four of the large kind which Miss\r\nMatty sold weighed that much), she always added one more by \"way of\r\nmake-weight,\" as she called it, although the scale was handsomely turned\r\nbefore; and when I remonstrated against this, her reply was, \"The little\r\nthings like it so much!\"  There was no use in telling her that the fifth\r\ncomfit weighed a quarter of an ounce, and made every sale into a loss to\r\nher pocket.  So I remembered the green tea, and winged my shaft with a\r\nfeather out of her own plumage.  I told her how unwholesome\r\nalmond-comfits were, and how ill excess in them might make the little\r\nchildren.  This argument produced some effect; for, henceforward,\r\ninstead of the fifth comfit, she always told them to hold out their tiny\r\npalms, into which she shook either peppermint or ginger lozenges, as a\r\npreventive to the dangers that might arise from the previous sale.\r\nAltogether the lozenge trade, conducted on these principles, did not\r\npromise to be remunerative; but I was happy to find she had made more\r\nthan twenty pounds during the last year by her sales of tea; and,\r\nmoreover, that now she was accustomed to it, she did not dislike the\r\nemployment, which brought her into kindly intercourse with many of the\r\npeople round about.  If she gave them good weight, they, in their turn,\r\nbrought many a little country present to the \"old rector's daughter\"; a\r\ncream cheese, a few new-laid eggs, a little fresh ripe fruit, a bunch of\r\nflowers.  The counter was quite loaded with these offerings sometimes,\r\nas she told me.",
    "As for Cranford in general, it was going on much as usual.  The Jamieson\r\nand Hoggins feud still raged, if a feud it could be called, when only\r\none side cared much about it.  Mr and Mrs Hoggins were very happy\r\ntogether, and, like most very happy people, quite ready to be friendly;\r\nindeed, Mrs Hoggins was really desirous to be restored to Mrs Jamieson's\r\ngood graces, because of the former intimacy.  But Mrs Jamieson\r\nconsidered their very happiness an insult to the Glenmire family, to\r\nwhich she had still the honour to belong, and she doggedly refused and\r\nrejected every advance. Mr Mulliner, like a faithful clansman, espoused\r\nhis mistress' side with ardour.  If he saw either Mr or Mrs Hoggins, he\r\nwould cross the street, and appear absorbed in the contemplation of life\r\nin general, and his own path in particular, until he had passed them by.\r\n Miss Pole used to amuse herself with wondering what in the world Mrs\r\nJamieson would do, if either she, or Mr Mulliner, or any other member of\r\nher household was taken ill; she could hardly have the face to call in\r\nMr Hoggins after the way she had behaved to them.  Miss Pole grew quite\r\nimpatient for some indisposition or accident to befall Mrs Jamieson or\r\nher dependents, in order that Cranford might see how she would act under\r\nthe perplexing circumstances.",
    "Martha was beginning to go about again, and I had already fixed a limit,\r\nnot very far distant, to my visit, when one afternoon, as I was sitting\r\nin the shop-parlour with Miss Matty-I remember the weather was colder\r\nnow than it had been in May, three weeks before, and we had a fire and\r\nkept the door fully closed-we saw a gentleman go slowly past the window,\r\nand then stand opposite to the door, as if looking out for the name\r\nwhich we had so carefully hidden.  He took out a double eyeglass and\r\npeered about for some time before he could discover it.  Then he came\r\nin.  And, all on a sudden, it flashed across me that it was the Aga\r\nhimself!  For his clothes had an out-of-the-way foreign cut about them,\r\nand his face was deep brown, as if tanned and re-tanned by the sun.  His\r\ncomplexion contrasted oddly with his plentiful snow-white hair, his eyes\r\nwere dark and piercing, and he had an odd way of contracting them and\r\npuckering up his cheeks into innumerable wrinkles when he looked\r\nearnestly at objects. He did so to Miss Matty when he first came in.\r\nHis glance had first caught and lingered a little upon me, but then\r\nturned, with the peculiar searching look I have described, to Miss\r\nMatty.  She was a little fluttered and nervous, but no more so than she\r\nalways was when any man came into her shop.  She thought that he would\r\nprobably have a note, or a sovereign at least, for which she would have\r\nto give change, which was an operation she very much disliked to\r\nperform.  But the present customer stood opposite to her, without asking\r\nfor anything, only looking fixedly at her as he drummed upon the table\r\nwith his fingers, just for all the world as Miss Jenkyns used to do.\r\nMiss Matty was on the point of asking him what he wanted (as she told me\r\nafterwards), when he turned sharp to me: \"Is your name Mary Smith?\"",
    "\"Yes!\" said I.",
    "All my doubts as to his identity were set at rest, and I only wondered\r\nwhat he would say or do next, and how Miss Matty would stand the joyful\r\nshock of what he had to reveal.  Apparently he was at a loss how to\r\nannounce himself, for he looked round at last in search of something to\r\nbuy, so as to gain time, and, as it happened, his eye caught on the\r\nalmond-comfits, and he boldly asked for a pound of \"those things.\"  I\r\ndoubt if Miss Matty had a whole pound in the shop, and, besides the\r\nunusual magnitude of the order, she was distressed with the idea of the\r\nindigestion they would produce, taken in such unlimited quantities.  She\r\nlooked up to remonstrate.  Something of tender relaxation in his face\r\nstruck home to her heart.  She said, \"It is-oh, sir! can you be Peter?\"\r\nand trembled from head to foot.  In a moment he was round the table and\r\nhad her in his arms, sobbing the tearless cries of old age.  I brought\r\nher a glass of wine, for indeed her colour had changed so as to alarm me\r\nand Mr Peter too.  He kept saying, \"I have been too sudden for you,\r\nMatty-I have, my little girl.\"",
    "I proposed that she should go at once up into the drawing-room and lie\r\ndown on the sofa there.  She looked wistfully at her brother, whose hand\r\nshe had held tight, even when nearly fainting; but on his assuring her\r\nthat he would not leave her, she allowed him to carry her upstairs.",
    "I thought that the best I could do was to run and put the kettle on the\r\nfire for early tea, and then to attend to the shop, leaving the brother\r\nand sister to exchange some of the many thousand things they must have\r\nto say.  I had also to break the news to Martha, who received it with a\r\nburst of tears which nearly infected me.  She kept recovering herself to\r\nask if I was sure it was indeed Miss Matty's brother, for I had\r\nmentioned that he had grey hair, and she had always heard that he was a\r\nvery handsome young man.  Something of the same kind perplexed Miss\r\nMatty at tea-time, when she was installed in the great easy-chair\r\nopposite to Mr Jenkyns in order to gaze her fill.  She could hardly\r\ndrink for looking at him, and as for eating, that was out of the\r\nquestion.",
    "\"I suppose hot climates age people very quickly,\" said she, almost to\r\nherself.  \"When you left Cranford you had not a grey hair in your head.\"",
    "\"But how many years ago is that?\" said Mr Peter, smiling.",
    "\"Ah, true! yes, I suppose you and I are getting old.  But still I did\r\nnot think we were so very old!  But white hair is very becoming to you,\r\nPeter,\" she continued-a little afraid lest she had hurt him by revealing\r\nhow his appearance had impressed her.",
    "\"I suppose I forgot dates too, Matty, for what do you think I have\r\nbrought for you from India?  I have an Indian muslin gown and a pearl\r\nnecklace for you somewhere in my chest at Portsmouth.\"  He smiled as if\r\namused at the idea of the incongruity of his presents with the\r\nappearance of his sister; but this did not strike her all at once, while\r\nthe elegance of the articles did.  I could see that for a moment her\r\nimagination dwelt complacently on the idea of herself thus attired; and\r\ninstinctively she put her hand up to her throat-that little delicate\r\nthroat which (as Miss Pole had told me) had been one of her youthful\r\ncharms; but the hand met the touch of folds of soft muslin in which she\r\nwas always swathed up to her chin, and the sensation recalled a sense of\r\nthe unsuitableness of a pearl necklace to her age.  She said, \"I'm\r\nafraid I'm too old; but it was very kind of you to think of it.  They\r\nare just what I should have liked years ago-when I was young.\"",
    "\"So I thought, my little Matty.  I remembered your tastes; they were so\r\nlike my dear mother's.\"  At the mention of that name the brother and\r\nsister clasped each other's hands yet more fondly, and, although they\r\nwere perfectly silent, I fancied they might have something to say if\r\nthey were unchecked by my presence, and I got up to arrange my room for\r\nMr Peter's occupation that night, intending myself to share Miss Matty's\r\nbed.  But at my movement, he started up.  \"I must go and settle about a\r\nroom at the 'George.'  My carpet-bag is there too.\"",
    "\"No!\" said Miss Matty, in great distress-\"you must not go; please, dear\r\nPeter-pray, Mary-oh! you must not go!\"",
    "She was so much agitated that we both promised everything she wished.\r\nPeter sat down again and gave her his hand, which for better security\r\nshe held in both of hers, and I left the room to accomplish my\r\narrangements.",
    "Long, long into the night, far, far into the morning, did Miss Matty and\r\nI talk.  She had much to tell me of her brother's life and adventures,\r\nwhich he had communicated to her as they had sat alone.  She said all\r\nwas thoroughly clear to her; but I never quite understood the whole\r\nstory; and when in after days I lost my awe of Mr Peter enough to\r\nquestion him myself, he laughed at my curiosity, and told me stories\r\nthat sounded so very much like Baron Munchausen's, that I was sure he\r\nwas making fun of me.  What I heard from Miss Matty was that he had been\r\na volunteer at the siege of Rangoon; had been taken prisoner by the\r\nBurmese; and somehow obtained favour and eventual freedom from knowing\r\nhow to bleed the chief of the small tribe in some case of dangerous\r\nillness; that on his release from years of captivity he had had his\r\nletters returned from England with the ominous word \"Dead\" marked upon\r\nthem; and, believing himself to be the last of his race, he had settled\r\ndown as an indigo planter, and had proposed to spend the remainder of\r\nhis life in the country to whose inhabitants and modes of life he had\r\nbecome habituated, when my letter had reached him; and, with the odd\r\nvehemence which characterised him in age as it had done in youth, he had\r\nsold his land and all his possessions to the first purchaser, and come\r\nhome to the poor old sister, who was more glad and rich than any\r\nprincess when she looked at him.  She talked me to sleep at last, and\r\nthen I was awakened by a slight sound at the door, for which she begged\r\nmy pardon as she crept penitently into bed; but it seems that when I\r\ncould no longer confirm her belief that the long-lost was really\r\nhere-under the same roof-she had begun to fear lest it was only a waking\r\ndream of hers; that there never had been a Peter sitting by her all that\r\nblessed evening-but that the real Peter lay dead far away beneath some\r\nwild sea-wave, or under some strange eastern tree. And so strong had\r\nthis nervous feeling of hers become, that she was fain to get up and go\r\nand convince herself that he was really there by listening through the\r\ndoor to his even, regular breathing-I don't like to call it snoring, but\r\nI heard it myself through two closed doors-and by-and-by it soothed Miss\r\nMatty to sleep.",
    "I don't believe Mr Peter came home from India as rich as a nabob; he\r\neven considered himself poor, but neither he nor Miss Matty cared much\r\nabout that.  At any rate, he had enough to live upon \"very genteelly\" at\r\nCranford; he and Miss Matty together.  And a day or two after his\r\narrival, the shop was closed, while troops of little urchins gleefully\r\nawaited the shower of comfits and lozenges that came from time to time\r\ndown upon their faces as they stood up-gazing at Miss Matty's\r\ndrawing-room windows.  Occasionally Miss Matty would say to them\r\n(half-hidden behind the curtains), \"My dear children, don't make\r\nyourselves ill;\" but a strong arm pulled her back, and a more rattling\r\nshower than ever succeeded.  A part of the tea was sent in presents to\r\nthe Cranford ladies; and some of it was distributed among the old people\r\nwho remembered Mr Peter in the days of his frolicsome youth.  The Indian\r\nmuslin gown was reserved for darling Flora Gordon (Miss Jessie Brown's\r\ndaughter).  The Gordons had been on the Continent for the last few\r\nyears, but were now expected to return very soon; and Miss Matty, in her\r\nsisterly pride, anticipated great delight in the joy of showing them Mr\r\nPeter.  The pearl necklace disappeared; and about that time many\r\nhandsome and useful presents made their appearance in the households of\r\nMiss Pole and Mrs Forrester; and some rare and delicate Indian ornaments\r\ngraced the drawing-rooms of Mrs Jamieson and Mrs Fitz-Adam.  I myself\r\nwas not forgotten.  Among other things, I had the handsomest-bound and\r\nbest edition of Dr Johnson's works that could be procured; and dear Miss\r\nMatty, with tears in her eyes, begged me to consider it as a present\r\nfrom her sister as well as herself.  In short, no one was forgotten;\r\nand, what was more, every one, however insignificant, who had shown\r\nkindness to Miss Matty at any time, was sure of Mr Peter's cordial\r\nregard.",
    ".\r\nPEACE TO CRANFORD",
    "IT was not surprising that Mr Peter became such a favourite at Cranford.\r\nThe ladies vied with each other who should admire him most; and no\r\nwonder, for their quiet lives were astonishingly stirred up by the\r\narrival from India-especially as the person arrived told more wonderful\r\nstories than Sindbad the Sailor; and, as Miss Pole said, was quite as\r\ngood as an Arabian Night any evening.  For my own part, I had vibrated\r\nall my life between Drumble and Cranford, and I thought it was quite\r\npossible that all Mr Peter's stories might be true, although wonderful;\r\nbut when I found that, if we swallowed an anecdote of tolerable\r\nmagnitude one week, we had the dose considerably increased the next, I\r\nbegan to have my doubts; especially as I noticed that when his sister\r\nwas present the accounts of Indian life were comparatively tame; not\r\nthat she knew more than we did, perhaps less.  I noticed also that when\r\nthe rector came to call, Mr Peter talked in a different way about the\r\ncountries he had been in.  But I don't think the ladies in Cranford\r\nwould have considered him such a wonderful traveller if they had only\r\nheard him talk in the quiet way he did to him.  They liked him the\r\nbetter, indeed, for being what they called \"so very Oriental.\"",
    "One day, at a select party in his honour, which Miss Pole gave, and from\r\nwhich, as Mrs Jamieson honoured it with her presence, and had even\r\noffered to send Mr Mulliner to wait, Mr and Mrs Hoggins and Mrs\r\nFitz-Adam were necessarily excluded-one day at Miss Pole's, Mr Peter\r\nsaid he was tired of sitting upright against the hard-backed uneasy\r\nchairs, and asked if he might not indulge himself in sitting\r\ncross-legged.  Miss Pole's consent was eagerly given, and down he went\r\nwith the utmost gravity.  But when Miss Pole asked me, in an audible\r\nwhisper, \"if he did not remind me of the Father of the Faithful?\" I\r\ncould not help thinking of poor Simon Jones, the lame tailor, and while\r\nMrs Jamieson slowly commented on the elegance and convenience of the\r\nattitude, I remembered how we had all followed that lady's lead in\r\ncondemning Mr Hoggins for vulgarity because he simply crossed his legs\r\nas he sat still on his chair.  Many of Mr Peter's ways of eating were a\r\nlittle strange amongst such ladies as Miss Pole, and Miss Matty, and Mrs\r\nJamieson, especially when I recollected the untasted green peas and\r\ntwo-pronged forks at poor Mr Holbrook's dinner.",
    "The mention of that gentleman's name recalls to my mind a conversation\r\nbetween Mr Peter and Miss Matty one evening in the summer after he\r\nreturned to Cranford.  The day had been very hot, and Miss Matty had\r\nbeen much oppressed by the weather, in the heat of which her brother\r\nrevelled. I remember that she had been unable to nurse Martha's baby,\r\nwhich had become her favourite employment of late, and which was as much\r\nat home in her arms as in its mother's, as long as it remained a\r\nlight-weight, portable by one so fragile as Miss Matty.  This day to\r\nwhich I refer, Miss Matty had seemed more than usually feeble and\r\nlanguid, and only revived when the sun went down, and her sofa was\r\nwheeled to the open window, through which, although it looked into the\r\nprincipal street of Cranford, the fragrant smell of the neighbouring\r\nhayfields came in every now and then, borne by the soft breezes that\r\nstirred the dull air of the summer twilight, and then died away.  The\r\nsilence of the sultry atmosphere was lost in the murmuring noises which\r\ncame in from many an open window and door; even the children were abroad\r\nin the street, late as it was (between ten and eleven), enjoying the\r\ngame of play for which they had not had spirits during the heat of the\r\nday.  It was a source of satisfaction to Miss Matty to see how few\r\ncandles were lighted, even in the apartments of those houses from which\r\nissued the greatest signs of life.  Mr Peter, Miss Matty, and I had all\r\nbeen quiet, each with a separate reverie, for some little time, when Mr\r\nPeter broke in-",
    "\"Do you know, little Matty, I could have sworn you were on the high road\r\nto matrimony when I left England that last time!  If anybody had told me\r\nyou would have lived and died an old maid then, I should have laughed in\r\ntheir faces.\"",
    "Miss Matty made no reply, and I tried in vain to think of some subject\r\nwhich should effectually turn the conversation; but I was very stupid;\r\nand before I spoke he went on-",
    "\"It was Holbrook, that fine manly fellow who lived at Woodley, that I\r\nused to think would carry off my little Matty.  You would not think it\r\nnow, I dare say, Mary; but this sister of mine was once a very pretty\r\ngirl-at least, I thought so, and so I've a notion did poor Holbrook.\r\nWhat business had he to die before I came home to thank him for all his\r\nkindness to a good-for-nothing cub as I was?  It was that that made me\r\nfirst think he cared for you; for in all our fishing expeditions it was\r\nMatty, Matty, we talked about.  Poor Deborah!  What a lecture she read\r\nme on having asked him home to lunch one day, when she had seen the\r\nArley carriage in the town, and thought that my lady might call.  Well,\r\nthat's long years ago; more than half a life-time, and yet it seems like\r\nyesterday!  I don't know a fellow I should have liked better as a\r\nbrother-in-law.  You must have played your cards badly, my little Matty,\r\nsomehow or another-wanted your brother to be a good go-between, eh,\r\nlittle one?\" said he, putting out his hand to take hold of hers as she\r\nlay on the sofa.  \"Why, what's this? you're shivering and shaking,\r\nMatty, with that confounded open window.  Shut it, Mary, this minute!\"",
    "I did so, and then stooped down to kiss Miss Matty, and see if she\r\nreally were chilled.  She caught at my hand, and gave it a hard\r\nsqueeze-but unconsciously, I think-for in a minute or two she spoke to\r\nus quite in her usual voice, and smiled our uneasiness away, although\r\nshe patiently submitted to the prescriptions we enforced of a warm bed\r\nand a glass of weak negus.  I was to leave Cranford the next day, and\r\nbefore I went I saw that all the effects of the open window had quite\r\nvanished.  I had superintended most of the alterations necessary in the\r\nhouse and household during the latter weeks of my stay.  The shop was\r\nonce more a parlour: the empty resounding rooms again furnished up to\r\nthe very garrets.",
    "There had been some talk of establishing Martha and Jem in another\r\nhouse, but Miss Matty would not hear of this.  Indeed, I never saw her\r\nso much roused as when Miss Pole had assumed it to be the most desirable\r\narrangement.  As long as Martha would remain with Miss Matty, Miss Matty\r\nwas only too thankful to have her about her; yes, and Jem too, who was a\r\nvery pleasant man to have in the house, for she never saw him from\r\nweek's end to week's end.  And as for the probable children, if they\r\nwould all turn out such little darlings as her god-daughter, Matilda,\r\nshe should not mind the number, if Martha didn't.  Besides, the next was\r\nto be called Deborah-a point which Miss Matty had reluctantly yielded to\r\nMartha's stubborn determination that her first-born was to be Matilda.\r\nSo Miss Pole had to lower her colours, and even her voice, as she said\r\nto me that, as Mr and Mrs Hearn were still to go on living in the same\r\nhouse with Miss Matty, we had certainly done a wise thing in hiring\r\nMartha's niece as an auxiliary.",
    "I left Miss Matty and Mr Peter most comfortable and contented; the only\r\nsubject for regret to the tender heart of the one, and the social\r\nfriendly nature of the other, being the unfortunate quarrel between Mrs\r\nJamieson and the plebeian Hogginses and their following.  In joke, I\r\nprophesied one day that this would only last until Mrs Jamieson or Mr\r\nMulliner were ill, in which case they would only be too glad to be\r\nfriends with Mr Hoggins; but Miss Matty did not like my looking forward\r\nto anything like illness in so light a manner, and before the year was\r\nout all had come round in a far more satisfactory way.",
    "I received two Cranford letters on one auspicious October morning.  Both\r\nMiss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to ask me to come over and meet the\r\nGordons, who had returned to England alive and well with their two\r\nchildren, now almost grown up.  Dear Jessie Brown had kept her old kind\r\nnature, although she had changed her name and station; and she wrote to\r\nsay that she and Major Gordon expected to be in Cranford on the\r\nfourteenth, and she hoped and begged to be remembered to Mrs Jamieson\r\n(named first, as became her honourable station), Miss Pole and Miss\r\nMatty-could she ever forget their kindness to her poor father and\r\nsister?-Mrs Forrester, Mr Hoggins (and here again came in an allusion to\r\nkindness shown to the dead long ago), his new wife, who as such must\r\nallow Mrs Gordon to desire to make her acquaintance, and who was,\r\nmoreover, an old Scotch friend of her husband's.  In short, every one\r\nwas named, from the rector-who had been appointed to Cranford in the\r\ninterim between Captain Brown's death and Miss Jessie's marriage, and\r\nwas now associated with the latter event-down to Miss Betty Barker.  All\r\nwere asked to the luncheon; all except Mrs Fitz-Adam, who had come to\r\nlive in Cranford since Miss Jessie Brown's days, and whom I found rather\r\nmoping on account of the omission.  People wondered at Miss Betty\r\nBarker's being included in the honourable list; but, then, as Miss Pole\r\nsaid, we must remember the disregard of the genteel proprieties of life\r\nin which the poor captain had educated his girls, and for his sake we\r\nswallowed our pride.  Indeed, Mrs Jamieson rather took it as a\r\ncompliment, as putting Miss Betty (formerly _her_ maid) on a level with\r\n\"those Hogginses.\"",
    "But when I arrived in Cranford, nothing was as yet ascertained of Mrs\r\nJamieson's own intentions; would the honourable lady go, or would she\r\nnot?  Mr Peter declared that she should and she would; Miss Pole shook\r\nher head and desponded.  But Mr Peter was a man of resources.  In the\r\nfirst place, he persuaded Miss Matty to write to Mrs Gordon, and to tell\r\nher of Mrs Fitz-Adam's existence, and to beg that one so kind, and\r\ncordial, and generous, might be included in the pleasant invitation.  An\r\nanswer came back by return of post, with a pretty little note for Mrs\r\nFitz-Adam, and a request that Miss Matty would deliver it herself and\r\nexplain the previous omission.  Mrs Fitz-Adam was as pleased as could\r\nbe, and thanked Miss Matty over and over again.  Mr Peter had said,\r\n\"Leave Mrs Jamieson to me;\" so we did; especially as we knew nothing\r\nthat we could do to alter her determination if once formed.",
    "I did not know, nor did Miss Matty, how things were going on, until Miss\r\nPole asked me, just the day before Mrs Gordon came, if I thought there\r\nwas anything between Mr Peter and Mrs Jamieson in the matrimonial line,\r\nfor that Mrs Jamieson was really going to the lunch at the \"George.\"\r\nShe had sent Mr Mulliner down to desire that there might be a footstool\r\nput to the warmest seat in the room, as she meant to come, and knew that\r\ntheir chairs were very high.  Miss Pole had picked this piece of news\r\nup, and from it she conjectured all sorts of things, and bemoaned yet\r\nmore. \"If Peter should marry, what would become of poor dear Miss Matty?\r\n And Mrs Jamieson, of all people!\"  Miss Pole seemed to think there were\r\nother ladies in Cranford who would have done more credit to his choice,\r\nand I think she must have had someone who was unmarried in her head, for\r\nshe kept saying, \"It was so wanting in delicacy in a widow to think of\r\nsuch a thing.\"",
    "When I got back to Miss Matty's I really did begin to think that Mr\r\nPeter might be thinking of Mrs Jamieson for a wife, and I was as unhappy\r\nas Miss Pole about it.  He had the proof sheet of a great placard in his\r\nhand.  \"Signor Brunoni, Magician to the King of Delhi, the Rajah of\r\nOude, and the great Lama of Thibet,\" &c. &c., was going to \"perform in\r\nCranford for one night only,\" the very next night; and Miss Matty,\r\nexultant, showed me a letter from the Gordons, promising to remain over\r\nthis gaiety, which Miss Matty said was entirely Peter's doing.  He had\r\nwritten to ask the signor to come, and was to be at all the expenses of\r\nthe affair.  Tickets were to be sent gratis to as many as the room would\r\nhold.  In short, Miss Matty was charmed with the plan, and said that\r\nto-morrow Cranford would remind her of the Preston Guild, to which she\r\nhad been in her youth-a luncheon at the \"George,\" with the dear Gordons,\r\nand the signor in the Assembly Room in the evening.  But I-I looked only\r\nat the fatal words:-",
    "\"_Under the Patronage of the_ HONOURABLE MRS JAMIESON.\"",
    "She, then, was chosen to preside over this entertainment of Mr Peter's;\r\nshe was perhaps going to displace my dear Miss Matty in his heart, and\r\nmake her life lonely once more!  I could not look forward to the morrow\r\nwith any pleasure; and every innocent anticipation of Miss Matty's only\r\nserved to add to my annoyance.",
    "So, angry and irritated, and exaggerating every little incident which\r\ncould add to my irritation, I went on till we were all assembled in the\r\ngreat parlour at the \"George.\"  Major and Mrs Gordon and pretty Flora\r\nand Mr Ludovic were all as bright and handsome and friendly as could be;\r\nbut I could hardly attend to them for watching Mr Peter, and I saw that\r\nMiss Pole was equally busy.  I had never seen Mrs Jamieson so roused and\r\nanimated before; her face looked full of interest in what Mr Peter was\r\nsaying.  I drew near to listen.  My relief was great when I caught that\r\nhis words were not words of love, but that, for all his grave face, he\r\nwas at his old tricks.  He was telling her of his travels in India, and\r\ndescribing the wonderful height of the Himalaya mountains: one touch\r\nafter another added to their size, and each exceeded the former in\r\nabsurdity; but Mrs Jamieson really enjoyed all in perfect good faith.  I\r\nsuppose she required strong stimulants to excite her to come out of her\r\napathy.  Mr Peter wound up his account by saying that, of course, at\r\nthat altitude there were none of the animals to be found that existed in\r\nthe lower regions; the game,-everything was different.  Firing one day\r\nat some flying creature, he was very much dismayed when it fell, to find\r\nthat he had shot a cherubim!  Mr Peter caught my eye at this moment, and\r\ngave me such a funny twinkle, that I felt sure he had no thoughts of Mrs\r\nJamieson as a wife from that time.  She looked uncomfortably amazed-",
    "\"But, Mr Peter, shooting a cherubim-don't you think-I am afraid that was\r\nsacrilege!\"",
    "Mr Peter composed his countenance in a moment, and appeared shocked at\r\nthe idea, which, as he said truly enough, was now presented to him for\r\nthe first time; but then Mrs Jamieson must remember that he had been\r\nliving for a long time among savages-all of whom were heathens-some of\r\nthem, he was afraid, were downright Dissenters.  Then, seeing Miss Matty\r\ndraw near, he hastily changed the conversation, and after a little\r\nwhile, turning to me, he said, \"Don't be shocked, prim little Mary, at\r\nall my wonderful stories.  I consider Mrs Jamieson fair game, and\r\nbesides I am bent on propitiating her, and the first step towards it is\r\nkeeping her well awake.  I bribed her here by asking her to let me have\r\nher name as patroness for my poor conjuror this evening; and I don't\r\nwant to give her time enough to get up her rancour against the\r\nHogginses, who are just coming in.  I want everybody to be friends, for\r\nit harasses Matty so much to hear of these quarrels.  I shall go at it\r\nagain by-and-by, so you need not look shocked.  I intend to enter the\r\nAssembly Room to-night with Mrs Jamieson on one side, and my lady, Mrs\r\nHoggins, on the other.  You see if I don't.\"",
    "Somehow or another he did; and fairly got them into conversation\r\ntogether.  Major and Mrs Gordon helped at the good work with their\r\nperfect ignorance of any existing coolness between any of the\r\ninhabitants of Cranford.",
    "Ever since that day there has been the old friendly sociability in\r\nCranford society; which I am thankful for, because of my dear Miss\r\nMatty's love of peace and kindliness.  We all love Miss Matty, and I\r\nsomehow think we are all of us better when she is near us.",

    "_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at\r\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an\r\nhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I\r\ngot of it from the train and the little I could walk through the\r\nstreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived\r\nlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. The\r\nimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\r\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\r\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\r\nrule.",
    "We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\r\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\r\nrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\r\nvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\r\nwaiter, and he said it was called \"paprika hendl,\" and that, as it was a\r\nnational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\r\nCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\r\ndon't know how I should be able to get on without it.",
    "Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\r\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\r\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\r\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\r\nnobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\r\nextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\r\nTransylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\r\nmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\r\nnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\r\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\r\nwith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\r\ntown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\r\nhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\r\ntravels with Mina.",
    "In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\r\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\r\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\r\nEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\r\nfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\r\nthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\r\nread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\r\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\r\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\r\nmust ask the Count all about them.)",
    "I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\r\nall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\r\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\r\nthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\r\nstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\r\nknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\r\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\r\nwhich they said was \"mamaliga,\" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\r\nvery excellent dish, which they call \"impletata.\" (_Mem._, get recipe\r\nfor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\r\nbefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\r\nthe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\r\nbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\r\nmore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?",
    "All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\r\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\r\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\r\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\r\nof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\r\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\r\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\r\nof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\r\nsaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\r\nand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\r\nlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\r\nabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\r\nand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\r\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\r\nwere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\r\nSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\r\nhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\r\nheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\r\nnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\r\nhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\r\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\r\nset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\r\nhowever, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\r\nself-assertion.",
    "It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\r\nvery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\r\nBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\r\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\r\nof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\r\noccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\r\na siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\r\nproper being assisted by famine and disease.",
    "Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\r\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\r\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\r\nevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\r\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\r\nundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\r\nfitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\r\nsaid, \"The Herr Englishman?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"Jonathan Harker.\" She\r\nsmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\r\nwho had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\r\na letter:--",
    "\"My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\r\n     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\r\n     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo\r\n     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust\r\n     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\r\n     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.",

    "_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\r\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\r\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\r\npretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\r\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\r\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\r\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\r\nway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\r\nwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\r\ntell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,\r\nand, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak\r\nfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask\r\nany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means\r\ncomforting.",
    "Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a\r\nvery hysterical way:",
    "\"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?\" She was in such an excited\r\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\r\nmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\r\nwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\r\nthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\r\nshe asked again:",
    "\"Do you know what day it is?\" I answered that it was the fourth of May.\r\nShe shook her head as she said again:",
    "\"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?\" On\r\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:",
    "\"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\r\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\r\nfull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\"\r\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\r\nwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\r\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\r\nridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\r\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\r\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\r\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\r\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\r\ndid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\r\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\r\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a\r\nstate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the\r\nrosary round my neck, and said, \"For your mother's sake,\" and went out\r\nof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting\r\nfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still\r\nround my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly\r\ntraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\r\nam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\r\never reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the\r\ncoach!",

    "_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is\r\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\r\nhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\r\nmixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\r\nnaturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\r\ndown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\r\nleft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\r\ncalled \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\r\npepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\r\nstyle of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\r\nproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\r\ndisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.",
    "When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\r\ntalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\r\nnow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\r\non the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\r\n\"word-bearer\"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\r\npityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\r\nthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\r\ndictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\r\ncheering to me, for amongst them were \"Ordog\"--Satan, \"pokol\"--hell,\r\n\"stregoica\"--witch, \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both of which mean the same\r\nthing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\r\neither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\r\nsuperstitions)",
    "When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\r\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\r\npointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\r\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\r\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\r\ncharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\r\njust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\r\nseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\r\ncould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\r\nhad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\r\nthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\r\nrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\r\ncentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\r\nthe whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big\r\nwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\r\nour journey.",
    "I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\r\nscene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\r\nlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\r\nbeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\r\nland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\r\nwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\r\nroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\r\nplum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\r\nthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\r\ngreen hills of what they call here the \"Mittel Land\" ran the road,\r\nlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\r\nstraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\r\nhillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\r\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\r\nwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\r\ntime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\r\nexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\r\nsnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\r\nthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\r\nin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\r\nTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\r\nand so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.",
    "Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\r\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\r\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\r\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\r\ndeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\r\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\r\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\r\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\r\nmountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\r\nthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\r\nwe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\r\npeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\r\nbe right before us:--",
    "\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God's seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.",
    "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\r\nus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\r\nemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\r\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\r\nwe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\r\nthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\r\nand as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\r\nwas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\r\nturn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\r\ndevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\r\nmany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\r\nand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\r\nshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\r\nagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its\r\nlong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\r\nroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\r\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\r\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\r\nstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\r\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\r\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\r\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\r\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\r\nlate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\r\nthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\r\ngreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\r\npeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\r\ngrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\r\nthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\r\nCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\r\nhills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could\r\nonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\r\nbut the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\r\nwalk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\r\nevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\r\napproving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\r\nbefore you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment's\r\npause to light his lamps.",
    "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\r\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\r\nthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\r\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\r\nto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\r\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\r\nhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\r\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\r\nstormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\r\nto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\r\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\r\nby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\r\nupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\r\ncertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\r\nfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\r\nfear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\r\nBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\r\nThen, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\r\npassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\r\ndarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\r\nhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\r\ngive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\r\nsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\r\nthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\r\nair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\r\nmountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\r\ninto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\r\nwhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\r\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\r\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\r\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\r\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\r\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\r\nmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\r\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\r\ncould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\r\nthought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\r\nin German worse than my own:--",
    "\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\r\nnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\r\nthe next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\r\nsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\r\namongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\r\nof themselves, a cal\u00e8che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\r\nus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\r\nlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\r\nsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\r\nbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\r\ncould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\r\nin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--",
    "\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--",
    "\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--",
    "\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\r\ndeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\r\nspoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\r\nvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\r\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger's \"Lenore\":--",
    "\"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\r\n    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")",
    "The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\r\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\r\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr's\r\nluggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\r\nhanded out and put in the cal\u00e8che. Then I descended from the side of the\r\ncoach, as the cal\u00e8che was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\r\nhand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\r\nprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\r\nswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\r\nfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\r\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\r\nthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\r\non their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\r\nstrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\r\nover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\r\nexcellent German:--",
    "\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\r\ncare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\r\ncountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\r\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\r\nlittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\r\nany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\r\nunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\r\nthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\r\nseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\r\nagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\r\nso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\r\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\r\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\r\ndelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\r\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\r\nwithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\r\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\r\nrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.",
    "Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\r\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\r\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\r\nnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\r\nto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\r\nit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\r\nstrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\r\nquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\r\nsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\r\nside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\r\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\r\njump from the cal\u00e8che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\r\nmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\r\nfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\r\nthe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\r\nto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\r\nwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\r\ndoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\r\nquite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\r\ntook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\r\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\r\nnarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.",
    "Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\r\nroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\r\nrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\r\ncould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\r\nrocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\r\nIt grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\r\nso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\r\nkeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\r\nfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\r\nand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\r\ngrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\r\nhowever, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\r\nleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",
    "Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\r\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\r\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\r\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\r\nI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\r\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\r\nand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\r\nendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\r\nOnce the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\r\naround us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where\r\nthe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\r\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\r\nformed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\r\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\r\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\r\nas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\r\nstraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\r\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\r\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.",
    "At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\r\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\r\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\r\nfor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\r\nthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\r\njagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\r\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\r\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\r\nterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\r\nFor myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\r\nfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\r\ntheir true import.",
    "All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\r\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\r\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\r\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\r\nhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\r\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\r\nring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\r\ncal\u00e8che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\r\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\r\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\r\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\r\nlong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\r\nfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\r\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.",
    "When I could see again the driver was climbing into the cal\u00e8che, and the\r\nwolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\r\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\r\nseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\r\ndarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\r\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\r\nalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\r\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\r\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\r\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\r\nsky.",
    "JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_",
    "_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\r\nawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\r\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\r\nways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\r\nit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.",
    "When the cal\u00e8che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\r\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\r\nstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\r\ncrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\r\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\r\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\r\nmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\r\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\r\nweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\r\nreins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\r\nof the dark openings.",
    "I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\r\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\r\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\r\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\r\nme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\r\nWhat sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\r\ncustomary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to\r\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's\r\nclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\r\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\r\nfull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\r\nI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\r\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\r\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\r\nin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\r\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\r\nand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\r\nwait the coming of the morning.",
    "Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\r\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\r\nlight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\r\nmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\r\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.",
    "Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\r\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\r\nof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\r\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\r\nthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\r\nopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\r\ngesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--",
    "\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no\r\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\r\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\r\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\r\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\r\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\r\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--",
    "\"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\r\nhappiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\r\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\r\nfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\r\nspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--",
    "\"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--",
    "\"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\r\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was\r\nspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\r\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\r\nprotested but he insisted:--",
    "\"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\r\navailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying\r\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\r\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\r\nheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\r\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\r\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\r\nflamed and flared.",
    "The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\r\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\r\nby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\r\nthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\r\nwelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\r\nanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\r\nfresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\r\nleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\r\ndoor:--",
    "\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\r\ntoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\r\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"",
    "The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have\r\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\r\nI discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\r\ntoilet, I went into the other room.",
    "I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\r\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\r\nhis hand to the table, and said:--",
    "\"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\r\nme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"",
    "I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\r\nHe opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\r\nit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\r\npleasure.",
    "\"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\r\nsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\r\ncome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\r\nwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\r\nand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\r\ndiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\r\nbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\r\nyour instructions in all matters.\"",
    "The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\r\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\r\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\r\nmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\r\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\r\nexperienced.",
    "By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn\r\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\r\nat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\r\nopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\r\nphysiognomy.",
    "His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\r\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\r\nhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\r\neyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\r\nhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\r\ncould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\r\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\r\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\r\nman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\r\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\r\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.",
    "Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\r\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\r\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\r\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\r\nthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\r\npoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\r\nrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\r\nhorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\r\nnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\r\ngrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\r\nprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\r\nfireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\r\nwindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\r\nstrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\r\ndown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes\r\ngleamed, and he said:--",
    "\"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!\"\r\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\r\nadded:--",
    "\"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\r\nhunter.\" Then he rose and said:--",
    "\"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\r\nshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\r\nso sleep well and dream well!\" With a courteous bow, he opened for me\r\nhimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....",
    "I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\r\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\r\nsake of those dear to me!",

    "_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\r\nlast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\r\nown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\r\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\r\npot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\r\nwas written:--",
    "\"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.\" I set to and\r\nenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\r\nmight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\r\nThere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\r\nextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\r\nis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\r\nThe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\r\nmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\r\nbeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\r\nthough in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\r\nbut there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\r\nthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\r\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\r\ncould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\r\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\r\nSome time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\r\nbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had\r\nit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\r\nthe castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was\r\nabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\r\nmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\r\nlibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.",
    "In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\r\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\r\nnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\r\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\r\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\r\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\r\nand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\r\nLondon Directory, the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the\r\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\r\nLaw List.",
    "Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\r\nentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\r\nnight's rest. Then he went on:--",
    "\"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\r\nwill interest you. These companions\"--and he laid his hand on some of\r\nthe books--\"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\r\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\r\nof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\r\nknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\r\nyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\r\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\r\nit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\r\nTo you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"",
    "\"But, Count,\" I said, \"you know and speak English thoroughly!\" He bowed\r\ngravely.",
    "\"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\r\nfear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\r\nthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"",
    "\"Indeed,\" I said, \"you speak excellently.\"",
    "\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\r\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\r\nenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\r\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\r\nknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\r\nlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\r\nspeaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long\r\nmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\r\nbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\r\nHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\r\nshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\r\nlearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\r\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\r\naway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\r\nimportant affairs in hand.\"",
    "Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\r\ncome into that room when I chose. He answered: \"Yes, certainly,\" and\r\nadded:--",
    "\"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\r\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\r\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\r\nmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\" I said I was sure of\r\nthis, and then he went on:--",
    "\"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\r\nnot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\r\nwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\r\nwhat strange things there may be.\"",
    "This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\r\ntalk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding\r\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\r\nSometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\r\npretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\r\nfrankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\r\nhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\r\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\r\nflames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\r\ncertain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\r\nare supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\r\nwhere treasure has been concealed. \"That treasure has been hidden,\" he\r\nwent on, \"in the region through which you came last night, there can be\r\nbut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\r\nWallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\r\nin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\r\npatriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\r\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\r\nto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\r\ntheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\r\ndestruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\r\nwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\r\nsheltered in the friendly soil.\"",
    "\"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\r\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\"\r\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\r\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--",
    "\"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\r\nappear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\r\ncan help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\r\nwould not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\r\nmarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\r\neven for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\r\nfind these places again?\"",
    "\"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even\r\nto look for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.",
    "\"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of London and of the house which you\r\nhave procured for me.\" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\r\nown room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\r\norder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\r\npassed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\r\nlit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\r\nin the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\r\nreading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I\r\ncame in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\r\nwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\r\neverything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\r\nsurroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\r\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\r\nmore than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--",
    "\"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\r\nI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\r\nfall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\r\nJonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\r\nin Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\r\nother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\"",
    "We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\r\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\r\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\r\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\r\nplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\r\ninscribe here:--",
    "\"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\r\nbe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\r\nwas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\r\nbuilt of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\r\nyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\r\nrust.",
    "\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\r\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\r\nthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\r\nthe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\r\nmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\r\nsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\r\nflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\r\nperiods back, I should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of stone\r\nimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\r\niron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\r\nchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\r\nto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\r\nvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\r\nway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\r\nbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\r\nlarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\r\nasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"",
    "When I had finished, he said:--",
    "\"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\r\nlive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\r\nday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\r\nalso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\r\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\r\ngaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\r\nsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\r\nand my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\r\nattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\r\nshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\r\nbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\r\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his words and his look\r\ndid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\r\nsmile look malignant and saturnine.",
    "Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\r\ntogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\r\nthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\r\nEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\r\ncertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\r\nthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\r\nestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\r\nYorkshire coast.",
    "It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he\r\nsaid; \"still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\r\nam informed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into\r\nthe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\r\nCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\r\nhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\r\nAfter supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\r\nme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\r\nafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\r\nsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in\r\nevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\r\nme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\r\nthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\r\nThey say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\r\nthe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\r\ntied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\r\ncan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\r\nwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\r\nDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--",
    "\"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\r\nlong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\r\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\r\nus,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.",
    "I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\r\nnotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\r\nwarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\r\nwritten of this day.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\r\ndiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\r\nthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\r\ncannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\r\nnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\r\nme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\r\ncould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\r\nand he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\r\nme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\r\nimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\r\nat once how I stand--or seem to.",
    "I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\r\nnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\r\nand was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\r\nand heard the Count's voice saying to me, \"Good-morning.\" I started, for\r\nit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\r\ncovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\r\nbut did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's\r\nsalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\r\nThis time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\r\ncould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\r\nthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\r\nsign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\r\nthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\r\nfeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\r\nthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\r\ntrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\r\nround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\r\neyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\r\nmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\r\nheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\r\nso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.",
    "\"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more\r\ndangerous than you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving\r\nglass, he went on: \"And this is the wretched thing that has done the\r\nmischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!\" and\r\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\r\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\r\nof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\r\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\r\nthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.",
    "When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\r\nnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\r\nas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\r\npeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\r\nwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\r\nview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\r\nof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\r\nstone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\r\ntouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\r\ntops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\r\nthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\r\nthe forests.",
    "But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\r\nexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\r\nbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\r\nan available exit.",
    "The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!",
    "JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_",
    "When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.\r\nI rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of\r\nevery window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\r\nhelplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a\r\nfew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\r\nas a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me\r\nthat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\r\nanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\r\nam thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\r\none thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\r\nthe Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\r\nhimself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\r\nme if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only\r\nplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes\r\nopen. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,\r\nor else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and\r\nshall need, all my brains to get through.",
    "I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\r\nshut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into\r\nthe library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making\r\nthe bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\r\nthought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him\r\nthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the\r\ndining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these\r\nmenial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.\r\nThis gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it\r\nmust have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that\r\nbrought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it\r\nmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his\r\nhand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the\r\ncoach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the\r\ncrucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless\r\nthat good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a\r\ncomfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing\r\nwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous\r\nshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there\r\nis something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,\r\na tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some\r\ntime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my\r\nmind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count\r\nDracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of\r\nhimself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,\r\nhowever, not to awake his suspicion.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few\r\nquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject\r\nwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of\r\nbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he\r\nafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house\r\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\r\nfate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said \"we,\"\r\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put\r\ndown all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\r\nfascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He\r\ngrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great\r\nwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as\r\nthough he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I\r\nshall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of\r\nhis race:--",
    "\"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood\r\nof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,\r\nin the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from\r\nIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their\r\nBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,\r\nand of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the\r\nwere-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found\r\nthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,\r\ntill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those\r\nold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the\r\ndesert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as\r\nAttila, whose blood is in these veins?\" He held up his arms. \"Is it a\r\nwonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the\r\nMagyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his\r\nthousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when\r\nArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us\r\nhere when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed\r\nthere? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were\r\nclaimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries\r\nwas trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more\r\nthan that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,\r\n'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we\r\nthroughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its\r\nwarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was\r\nredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the\r\nflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who\r\nwas it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat\r\nthe Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that\r\nhis own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the\r\nTurk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,\r\nindeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and\r\nagain brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,\r\nwhen he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had\r\nto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being\r\nslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They\r\nsaid that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants\r\nwithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to\r\nconduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Moh\u00e1cs, we threw off the\r\nHungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for\r\nour spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the\r\nSzekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and\r\ntheir swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the\r\nHapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.\r\nBlood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and\r\nthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\"",
    "It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this\r\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the \"Arabian Nights,\" for\r\neverything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet's\r\nfather.)",

    "_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by\r\nbooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not\r\nconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\r\nobservation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from\r\nhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the\r\ndoing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over\r\nbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\r\nmatters I had been examining at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain\r\nmethod in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in\r\nsequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.",
    "First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\r\ntold him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be\r\nwise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only\r\none could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate\r\nagainst his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to\r\nask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to\r\nattend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case\r\nlocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\r\nsolicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any\r\nchance mislead him, so he said:--",
    "\"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\r\nthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\r\nLondon, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\r\nhere let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\r\nsought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\r\nresident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\r\nserved save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\r\nhave some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\r\nseek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\r\nI, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or\r\nDurham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\r\nease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\" I answered that\r\ncertainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\r\nagency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\r\ninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\r\nhimself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by\r\nhim without further trouble.",
    "\"But,\" said he, \"I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\"",
    "\"Of course,\" I replied; and \"such is often done by men of business, who\r\ndo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\"",
    "\"Good!\" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\r\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\r\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\r\nagainst. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\r\nand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\r\nwonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\r\nforesee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\r\nevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\r\nwonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\r\nspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\r\navailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--",
    "\"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\r\nHawkins, or to any other?\" It was with some bitterness in my heart that\r\nI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\r\nsending letters to anybody.",
    "\"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, laying a heavy hand on my\r\nshoulder: \"write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\r\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\"",
    "\"Do you wish me to stay so long?\" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\r\nthought.",
    "\"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\r\nemployer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\r\nit was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\r\nstinted. Is it not so?\"",
    "What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not\r\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\r\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\r\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\r\ncould have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\r\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\r\nin his own smooth, resistless way:--",
    "\"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things\r\nother than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\r\nfriends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\r\nhome to them. Is it not so?\" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\r\nnote-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\r\npost, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\r\nwith the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\r\nas well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\r\nhe would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\r\nnow, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\r\nto her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\r\ndid see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\r\nbook whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\r\nsome books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\r\nown, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\r\nhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\r\nwere face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\r\nunder the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\r\nI could.",
    "One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\r\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\r\nCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\r\nbankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\r\nabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\r\nseat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\r\nto resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\r\nhand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\r\nthem carefully, and then turning to me, said:--",
    "\"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\r\nevening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\" At the door he\r\nturned, and after a moment's pause said:--",
    "\"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\r\nseriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\r\nchance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\r\nmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\r\nwarned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then\r\nhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\r\nsafe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then\"--He finished his\r\nspeech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\r\nwashing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\r\ndream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\r\nand mystery which seemed closing around me.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\r\ndoubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\r\nnot. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\r\nmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.",
    "When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any\r\nsound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out\r\ntowards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,\r\ninaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness\r\nof the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in\r\nprison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of\r\nthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.\r\nIt is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all\r\nsorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my\r\nterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful\r\nexpanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as\r\nday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows\r\nin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed\r\nto cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I\r\nleaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey\r\nbelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of\r\nthe rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The\r\nwindow at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though\r\nweatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since\r\nthe case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked\r\ncarefully out.",
    "What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not\r\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\r\nback and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had\r\nso many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\r\nsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\r\nand amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to\r\nrepulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the\r\nwindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,\r\n_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At\r\nfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the\r\nmoonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could\r\nbe no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the\r\nstones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus\r\nusing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable\r\nspeed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.",
    "What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\r\nsemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\r\nme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\r\nencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.\r\nHe moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\r\ndeal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\r\nhad disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\r\navail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\r\nknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\r\nexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\r\ntaking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\r\nexpected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\r\nstone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\r\npull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\r\ndoor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's\r\nroom; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\r\nescape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\r\nand passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\r\nsmall rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\r\nthem except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\r\nhowever, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\r\nseemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\r\nand found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\r\nfrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\r\nrested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\r\nagain, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\r\nI could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\r\nthan the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\r\nsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\r\nwindows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\r\nside, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\r\nwas built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\r\nquite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\r\nbow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\r\nimpossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\r\nwest was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\r\nmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\r\nmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\r\ncrannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\r\noccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\r\ncomfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\r\nyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\r\nsee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\r\nall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\r\nlamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\r\nglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\r\nwhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\r\nthan living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\r\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\r\nfound a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\r\ntable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\r\nthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\r\ndiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\r\nnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\r\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own\r\nwhich mere \"modernity\" cannot kill.",

    "_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\r\nam reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.\r\nWhilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not\r\ngo mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it\r\nis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this\r\nhateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I\r\ncan look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his\r\npurpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way\r\nlies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which\r\nhave puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant\r\nwhen he made Hamlet say:--",
    "\"My tablets! quick, my tablets!\r\n    'Tis meet that I put it down,\" etc.,",
    "for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock\r\nhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.\r\nThe habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.",
    "The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens\r\nme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon\r\nme. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!",
    "When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and\r\npen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,\r\nbut I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,\r\nand with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft\r\nmoonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom\r\nwhich refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the\r\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat\r\nand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\r\ntheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great\r\ncouch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look\r\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for\r\nthe dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen\r\nasleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly\r\nreal--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the\r\nmorning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.",
    "I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\r\ncame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\r\nmy own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\r\ndust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\r\ntheir dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\r\nwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\r\nno shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\r\ntime, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\r\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\r\nalmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\r\nfair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\r\nlike pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\r\nin connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\r\nmoment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\r\npearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\r\nabout them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\r\ndeadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\r\nkiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\r\nday it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\r\nThey whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\r\nsilvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\r\ncome through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\r\ntingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\r\nThe fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\r\non. One said:--",
    "\"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\r\nbegin.\" The other added:--",
    "\"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\" I lay quiet,\r\nlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\r\nThe fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\r\nof her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\r\nthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\r\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.",
    "I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\r\nthe lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\r\ngloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\r\nand repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\r\nlike an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\r\non the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\r\nteeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\r\nmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\r\npaused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\r\nher teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\r\nskin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that\r\nis to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\r\nshivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\r\nand the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\r\nI closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\r\nheart.",
    "But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\r\nlightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\r\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\r\nsaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\r\ngiant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\r\nwhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\r\npassion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\r\nthe demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\r\nin them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\r\nface was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\r\nthe thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\r\nof white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\r\nfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\r\nthem back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\r\nwolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\r\ncut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--",
    "\"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\r\nI had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\r\nhow you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me.\" The fair girl,\r\nwith a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--",
    "\"You yourself never loved; you never love!\" On this the other women\r\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\r\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\r\nof fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\r\nand said in a soft whisper:--",
    "\"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\r\nnot so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\r\nkiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\r\nto be done.\"",
    "\"Are we to have nothing to-night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh,\r\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\r\nmoved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\r\nnodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\r\nears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\r\nhalf-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\r\nhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\r\nbag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\r\nwithout my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\r\nmoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\r\ndim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.",
    "Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.",
    "JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_",
    "I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must\r\nhave carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but\r\ncould not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were\r\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by\r\nin a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am\r\nrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and\r\nmany such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been\r\nevidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or\r\nanother, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one\r\nthing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed\r\nme, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I\r\nam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not\r\nhave brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this\r\nroom, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of\r\nsanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who\r\nwere--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.",

It had been so forcibly driven against the\r\njamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt\r\nof the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.\r\nI fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.",

    "_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in\r\nthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here\r\nwas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,\r\nanother that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the\r\nletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at\r\nBistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state\r\nof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I\r\nam so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his\r\nsuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and\r\nthat I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to\r\nprolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a\r\nchance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath\r\nwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained\r\nto me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would\r\nensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much\r\nimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would\r\nbe held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my\r\nprolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new\r\nsuspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked\r\nhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and\r\nthen said:--",

It is\r\nnot signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.\" And he calmly held letter\r\nand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he\r\nwent on:--",
    "\"The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is\r\nyours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that\r\nunknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?\" He held\r\nout the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean\r\nenvelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When\r\nhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later\r\nI went over and tried it, and the door was locked.",
    "When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\r\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very\r\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\r\nsleeping, he said:--",
    "\"So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I\r\nmay not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours\r\nto me; but you will sleep, I pray.\" I passed to my room and went to bed,\r\nand, strange to say, slept without dreaming.

    "Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,\r\nrelating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that\r\nmight be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered\r\nawhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my\r\nportmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.",
    "The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and\r\nrug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new\r\nscheme of villainy....",

    "_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\r\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding\r\nand scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.\r\nWith joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great\r\nleiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of\r\neach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty\r\nsheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I\r\nran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the\r\nmain hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a\r\nshock: my door was fastened on the outside.",
    "Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me\r\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the \"hetman\" of the Szgany came out,\r\nand seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they\r\nlaughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised\r\nentreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.\r\nThe leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\r\nrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\r\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When\r\nthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the\r\nyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on\r\nit for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I\r\nheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.",

    "_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and\r\nlocked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the\r\nwinding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I\r\nthought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.\r\nThe Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of\r\nsome kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound\r\nas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some\r\nruthless villainy.",
    "I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\r\nsomething coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched\r\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to\r\nfind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\r\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\r\nhad seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,\r\nand in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will\r\nallow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave\r\nevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own\r\nletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local\r\npeople be attributed to me.",
    "It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up\r\nhere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which\r\nis even a criminal's right and consolation.",
    "I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat\r\ndoggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some\r\nquaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were\r\nlike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in\r\nclusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of\r\nsoothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the\r\nembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more\r\nfully the a\u00ebrial gambolling.",
    "Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far\r\nbelow in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to\r\nring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to\r\nthe sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to\r\nawake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,\r\nand my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I\r\nwas becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the\r\nmoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom\r\nbeyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom\r\nshapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my\r\nsenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were\r\nbecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the\r\nthree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat\r\nsafer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp\r\nwas burning brightly.",
    "When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\r\nCount's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then\r\nthere was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a\r\nbeating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and\r\ncould do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.",
    "As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a\r\nwoman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between\r\nthe bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her\r\nhands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning\r\nagainst a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she\r\nthrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--",
    "\"Monster, give me my child!\"",
    "She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same\r\nwords in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her\r\nbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant\r\nemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see\r\nher, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.",
    "Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the\r\nCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be\r\nanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes\r\nhad passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,\r\nthrough the wide entrance into the courtyard.",
    "There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\r\nshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.",
    "I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\r\nshe was better dead.",
    "What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful\r\nthing of night and gloom and fear?",

    "_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night\r\nhow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the\r\nsun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great\r\ngateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me\r\nas if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as\r\nif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must\r\ntake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last\r\nnight one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal\r\nseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the\r\nearth.",
    "Let me not think of it. Action!",
    "It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\r\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the\r\nCount in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that\r\nhe may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!\r\nBut there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.",
    "Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone\r\nwhy may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his\r\nwindow. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The\r\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk\r\nit. At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a\r\ncalf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me\r\nin my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and\r\nsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!",

    "_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have\r\ncome safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I\r\nwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\r\nside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs\r\naround the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,\r\nand the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I\r\ntook off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down\r\nonce, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would\r\nnot overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty\r\nwell the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it\r\nas well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did\r\nnot feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed\r\nridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and\r\ntrying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when\r\nI bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked\r\naround for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.\r\nThe room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which\r\nseemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same\r\nstyle as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked\r\nfor the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it\r\nanywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one\r\ncorner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and\r\nHungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as\r\nthough it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was\r\nless than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,\r\nsome jewelled, but all of them old and stained.",
    "At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I\r\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\r\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\r\nall my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone\r\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,\r\nminding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit\r\nby loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,\r\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\r\nodour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell\r\ngrew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood\r\najar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently\r\nbeen used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were\r\nsteps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and\r\nthe earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been\r\nbrought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for\r\nany further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of\r\nthe ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the\r\nvaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to\r\nmy very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\r\nof old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a\r\ndiscovery.",
    "There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a\r\npile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I\r\ncould not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the\r\nglassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all\r\ntheir pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of\r\nmovement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,\r\nand tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain\r\nthere long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.\r\nBy the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.\r\nI thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw\r\nthe dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,\r\nthough unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and\r\nleaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle\r\nwall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried\r\nto think....",

    "_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has\r\ntaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the\r\ncastle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,\r\nlizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might\r\ndestroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would\r\nhave any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared\r\nto see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there\r\ntill I fell asleep.",
    "I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can\r\nlook as he said:--",
    "\"To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful\r\nEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never\r\nmeet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be\r\nhere, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the\r\nSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some\r\nSlovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall\r\nbear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to\r\nBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle\r\nDracula.\" I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.\r\nSincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in\r\nconnection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--",
    "\"Why may I not go to-night?\"",
    "\"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\"",
    "\"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\" He smiled,\r\nsuch a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick\r\nbehind his smoothness. He said:--",
    "\"And your baggage?\"",
    "\"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\"",
    "The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my\r\neyes, it seemed so real:--",
    "\"You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is\r\nthat which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting\r\nguest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait\r\nin my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that\r\nyou so suddenly desire it. Come!\" With a stately gravity, he, with the\r\nlamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he\r\nstopped.",
    "\"Hark!\"",
    "Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the\r\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great\r\norchestra seems to leap under the b\u00e2ton of the conductor. After a pause\r\nof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back\r\nthe ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it\r\nopen.",
    "To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I\r\nlooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.",
    "As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder\r\nand angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed\r\nfeet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that\r\nto struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such\r\nallies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door\r\ncontinued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.\r\nSuddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my\r\ndoom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There\r\nwas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and\r\nas a last chance I cried out:--",
    "\"Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!\" and covered my face with my\r\nhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his\r\npowerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged\r\nand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.",
    "In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\r\nto my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand\r\nto me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that\r\nJudas in hell might be proud of.",
    "When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\r\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears\r\ndeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--",
    "\"Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have\r\npatience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!\" There was a low,\r\nsweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw\r\nwithout the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they\r\nall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.",
    "I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near\r\nthe end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am\r\ndear!",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this\r\ndiary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself\r\non my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me\r\nready.",
    "At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning\r\nhad come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.\r\nWith a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen\r\nthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands\r\nthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the\r\nmassive bolts.",
    "But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at\r\nthe door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\r\ncasement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the\r\nCount.",
    "Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\r\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's\r\nroom. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\r\nevils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled\r\ndown the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that\r\nwas as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold\r\nremained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding\r\nstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well\r\nenough where to find the monster I sought.",
    "The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid\r\nwas laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their\r\nplaces to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so\r\nI raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\r\nsomething which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\r\nbut looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\r\nand moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\r\nand the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\r\never, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\r\ncorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\r\nburning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\r\nunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\r\nsimply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\r\nrepletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\r\nme revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\r\ncoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\r\nhorrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\r\nkey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\r\non the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\r\nwas helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\r\nhe might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\r\ncreate a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\r\nhelpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\r\nto rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\r\nbut I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\r\ncases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\r\nhateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\r\nupon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\r\nparalyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\r\nmerely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\r\nhand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\r\ncaught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\r\nthing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\r\nblood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\r\nown in the nethermost hell.",
    "I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\r\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\r\nwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\r\ncloser, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\r\ncracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\r\nspoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\r\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's\r\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\r\nWith strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\r\nkey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\r\nhave been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\r\nthe locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\r\ndying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to\r\nrun down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;\r\nbut at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the\r\ndoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from\r\nthe lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\r\nhopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing\r\nround me more closely.",
    "As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\r\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\r\nwith their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the\r\nbox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\r\nalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.",
    "The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\r\nin the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and\r\nshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.",
    "Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\r\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\r\ndistance.",
    "I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,\r\nand there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!",
    "I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall\r\nfarther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with\r\nme, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.",
    "And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away\r\nfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\r\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!",
    "At least God's mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the\r\nprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.\r\nGood-bye, all! Mina!",

When we are married I shall\r\nbe able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I\r\ncan take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for\r\nhim on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He\r\nand I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a\r\nstenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I\r\nshall keep a diary in the same way. I don't mean one of those\r\ntwo-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a\r\nsort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not\r\nsuppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not\r\nintended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it\r\nanything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try\r\nto do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing\r\ndescriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with\r\na little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears\r\nsaid during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little\r\nplans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan\r\nfrom Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I\r\nam longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange\r\ncountries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them\r\ntogether. There is the ten o'clock bell ringing. Good-bye.",

    "\"I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I\r\nwrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your\r\n_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing\r\nto interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal\r\nto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the\r\ntall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the\r\nlast Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.\r\nHolmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well\r\ntogether; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some\r\ntime ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already\r\nengaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well\r\noff, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He\r\nis only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under\r\nhis own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to\r\nsee us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men\r\nI ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I\r\ncan fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has\r\na curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to\r\nread one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter\r\nmyself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do\r\nyou ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not\r\na bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you\r\nhave never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological\r\nstudy, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient\r\ninterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a\r\nbore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.\r\nThere, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other\r\nsince we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and\r\nlaughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like\r\nto speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess? I love him. I am blushing\r\nas I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in\r\nwords. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that\r\ndoes me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire\r\nundressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.\r\nI do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,\r\nor I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I _do_ so\r\nwant to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all\r\nthat you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your\r\nprayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.",

    "\"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.\r\nHere am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a\r\nproposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.\r\nJust fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry,\r\nreally and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so\r\nhappy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals!\r\nBut, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be\r\ngetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured\r\nand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at\r\nleast. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and\r\nare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can\r\ndespise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep\r\nit a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You\r\nwill tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell\r\nArthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think\r\nso, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to\r\nbe quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always\r\nquite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just\r\nbefore lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum\r\nman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool\r\noutwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling\r\nhimself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he\r\nalmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do\r\nwhen they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept\r\nplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to\r\nme, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,\r\nthough he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to\r\nhelp and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I\r\ndid not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute\r\nand would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if\r\nI could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,\r\nand then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one\r\nelse. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my\r\nconfidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was\r\nfree a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to\r\ntell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he\r\nstood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my\r\nhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever\r\nwanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't\r\nhelp crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being\r\nproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at\r\nall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know\r\nloves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to\r\nknow that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing\r\nquite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so\r\nmiserable, though I am so happy.",
    "\"_Evening._",
    "\"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left\r\noff, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two\r\ncame after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and\r\nhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he\r\nhas been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise\r\nwith poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her\r\near, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that\r\nwe think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now\r\nwhat I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I\r\ndon't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never\r\ntold any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.\r\nMorris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl\r\nalone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I\r\nhelping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you\r\nbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say,\r\nhe never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well\r\neducated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me\r\nto hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there\r\nwas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my\r\ndear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he\r\nhas to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall\r\never speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never\r\nheard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked\r\nas happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was\r\nvery nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--",
    "\"'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your\r\nlittle shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you\r\nwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't\r\nyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road\r\ntogether, driving in double harness?'",
    "\"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem\r\nhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as\r\nlightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I\r\nwasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in\r\na light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so\r\non so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He\r\nreally did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help\r\nfeeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid\r\nflirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was\r\nnumber two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he\r\nbegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very\r\nheart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall\r\nnever again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,\r\nbecause he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face\r\nwhich checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of\r\nmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--",
    "\"'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here\r\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right\r\nthrough to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow\r\nto another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is\r\nI'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will\r\nlet me, a very faithful friend.'",
    "\"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy\r\nof them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true\r\ngentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think\r\nthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very\r\nbadly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want\r\nher, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say\r\nit. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into\r\nMr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--",
    "\"'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he\r\neven loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a\r\nlight came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I\r\nthink I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--",
    "\"'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of\r\nwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't\r\ncry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it\r\nstanding up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd\r\nbetter look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,\r\nyour honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a\r\nlover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty\r\nlonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?\r\nIt'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you\r\nknow, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,\r\nmy dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken\r\nyet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and\r\nnoble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and\r\nkissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down\r\ninto my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--",
    "\"'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these\r\nthings don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet\r\nhonesty to me, and good-bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,\r\nwent straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a\r\nquiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like\r\nthat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would\r\nworship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only\r\nI don't want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I\r\ncannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I\r\ndon't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.",

    "_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\r\nlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\r\nwhich they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\r\nEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\r\nharbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\r\nview seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\r\nbeautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\r\non either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\r\nsee down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\r\nred-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\r\npictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\r\nAbbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\r\n\"Marmion,\" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\r\nruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\r\na legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\r\nthe town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\r\ngraveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\r\nWhitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the\r\nharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness\r\nstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\r\npart of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been\r\ndestroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\r\nout over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\r\nthem, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\r\nlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\r\nsit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\r\nbook on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\r\nsitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and\r\ntalk.",
    "The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall\r\nstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in\r\nthe middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\r\nof it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\r\nand its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\r\nnarrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.",
    "It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\r\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\r\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this\r\nside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\r\nwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\r\nit is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\r\nmournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\r\nlost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he\r\nis coming this way....",
    "He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\r\ngnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is\r\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\r\nfleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\r\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\r\nat the abbey he said very brusquely:--",
    "\"I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.\r\nMind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in\r\nmy time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,\r\nbut not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and\r\nLeeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin'\r\nout to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be\r\nbothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of\r\nfool-talk.\" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting\r\nthings from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about\r\nthe whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin\r\nwhen the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--",
    "\"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn't like\r\nto be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to\r\ncrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em; an', miss, I lack\r\nbelly-timber sairly by the clock.\"",
    "He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down\r\nthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from\r\nthe town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how\r\nmany--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that\r\na horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally\r\nhave had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went\r\nout visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did\r\nnot go.

If he can't out-argue them he bullies\r\nthem, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views.

    "I could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in\r\nwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was\r\n\"showing off,\" so I put in a word to keep him going:--",
    "\"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these tombstones are not\r\nall wrong?\"",
    "\"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they make\r\nout the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be\r\nlike the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now\r\nlook you here; you come here a stranger, an' you see this kirk-garth.\" I\r\nnodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite\r\nunderstand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.\r\nHe went on: \"And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be\r\nhapped here, snod an' snog?\" I assented again. \"Then that be just where\r\nthe lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as\r\nold Dun's 'bacca-box on Friday night.\" He nudged one of his companions,\r\nand they all laughed. \"And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at\r\nthat one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!\" I went over and\r\nread:--",
    "\"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of\r\nAndres, April, 1854, \u00e6t. 30.\" When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--",
    "\"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast\r\nof Andres! an' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a\r\ndozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above\"--he pointed\r\nnorthwards--\"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the\r\nsteans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of\r\nthe lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in\r\nthe _Lively_ off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the\r\nsame seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year\r\nlater; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned\r\nin the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have\r\nto make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums\r\naboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' an'\r\njostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice\r\nin the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an'\r\ntryin' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.\" This was\r\nevidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his\r\ncronies joined in with gusto.",
    "\"But,\" I said, \"surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the\r\nassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to\r\ntake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think\r\nthat will be really necessary?\"",
    "\"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!\"",
    "\"To please their relatives, I suppose.\"",
    "\"To please their relatives, you suppose!\" This he said with intense\r\nscorn. \"How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote\r\nover them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?\" He\r\npointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on\r\nwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. \"Read the\r\nlies on that thruff-stean,\" he said. The letters were upside down to me\r\nfrom where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over\r\nand read:--",
    "\"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a\r\nglorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at\r\nKettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly\r\nbeloved son. 'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'\r\nReally, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!\" She spoke\r\nher comment very gravely and somewhat severely.",
    "\"Ye don't see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that's because ye don't gawm the\r\nsorrowin' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was\r\nacrewk'd--a regular lamiter he was--an' he hated her so that he\r\ncommitted suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on\r\nhis life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that\r\nthey had for scarin' the crows with. 'Twarn't for crows then, for it\r\nbrought the clegs and the dowps to him. That's the way he fell off the\r\nrocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've often heard him\r\nsay masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for his mother was so pious\r\nthat she'd be sure to go to heaven, an' he didn't want to addle where\r\nshe was. Now isn't that stean at any rate\"--he hammered it with his\r\nstick as he spoke--\"a pack of lies? and won't it make Gabriel keckle\r\nwhen Geordie comes pantin' up the grees with the tombstean balanced on\r\nhis hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!\"",
    "I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she\r\nsaid, rising up:--",
    "\"Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot\r\nleave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a\r\nsuicide.\"",
    "\"That won't harm ye, my pretty; an' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to\r\nhave so trim a lass sittin' on his lap. That won't hurt ye. Why, I've\r\nsat here off an' on for nigh twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me\r\nno harm. Don't ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn' lie\r\nthere either! It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the\r\ntombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.\r\nThere's the clock, an' I must gang.

    "Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we\r\ntook hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and\r\ntheir coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I\r\nhaven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month.",

    "_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no\r\nletter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.\r\nThe clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the\r\ntown, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;\r\nthey run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my\r\nleft the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next\r\nthe abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind\r\nme, and there is a clatter of a donkey's hoofs up the paved road below.\r\nThe band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further\r\nalong the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.\r\nNeither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them\r\nboth. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he\r\nwere here.",

    "_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to\r\nunderstand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;\r\nselfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the\r\nobject of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,\r\nbut what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of\r\nanimals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I\r\nsometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd\r\nsorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a\r\nquantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he\r\ndid not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in\r\nsimple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: \"May I have\r\nthree days? I shall clear them away.\" Of course, I said that would do. I\r\nmust watch him.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several\r\nvery big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and\r\nthe number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he\r\nhas used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his\r\nroom.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his\r\nflies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked\r\nvery sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all\r\nevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time\r\nas before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a\r\nhorrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,\r\nhe caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger\r\nand thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his\r\nmouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it\r\nwas very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and\r\ngave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must\r\nwatch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem\r\nin his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always\r\njotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of\r\nfigures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the\r\ntotals added in batches again, as though he were \"focussing\" some\r\naccount, as the auditors put it.",

    "_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in\r\nmy mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,\r\nunconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your\r\nconscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I\r\nmight notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except\r\nthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has\r\nmanaged to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means\r\nof taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that\r\ndo remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by\r\ntempting them with his food.",

    "_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of\r\nsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came\r\nin he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,\r\nvery great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked\r\nhim what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and\r\nbearing:--",
    "\"A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,\r\nand teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!\" I was not unprepared for this\r\nrequest, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and\r\nvivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows\r\nshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so\r\nI said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a\r\ncat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--",
    "\"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should\r\nrefuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?\" I shook\r\nmy head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but\r\nthat I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of\r\ndanger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant\r\nkilling. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him\r\nwith his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know\r\nmore.",

When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and\r\nimplored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.\r\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon\r\nhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner\r\nwhere I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.",

He was spreading out his sugar,\r\nwhich he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his\r\nfly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I\r\nlooked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they\r\nwere. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.\r\nThere were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of\r\nblood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if\r\nthere were anything odd about him during the day.",

    "_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has\r\nbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. \"My belief is,\r\ndoctor,\" he said, \"that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took\r\nand ate them raw!\"",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make\r\neven him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought\r\nthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory\r\nproved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to\r\ninvent a new classification for him, and call him a zo\u00f6phagous\r\n(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he\r\ncan, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He\r\ngave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then\r\nwanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later\r\nsteps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It\r\nmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at\r\nvivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science\r\nin its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had\r\nI even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of\r\neven one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch\r\ncompared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's\r\nbrain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient\r\ncause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good\r\ncause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an\r\nexceptional brain, congenitally?",
    "How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I\r\nwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has\r\nclosed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How\r\nmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?",
    "To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,\r\nand that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great\r\nRecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to\r\nprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be\r\nangry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on\r\nhopeless and work. Work! work!",

    "_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it\r\nis like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time. And\r\nthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it\r\ndifferent from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I\r\nhad not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but\r\nyesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from\r\nhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed\r\nhad just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,\r\nand says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;\r\nI do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,\r\nalthough she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in\r\nher sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided\r\nthat I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has\r\ngot an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and\r\nalong the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over\r\nwith a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is\r\nnaturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's\r\nfather, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress\r\nhimself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the\r\nautumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is\r\nto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan\r\nand I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to\r\nmake both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only\r\nson of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can\r\nleave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is\r\ncounting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat\r\non the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it\r\nis the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he\r\narrives.",

    "_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,\r\nthough why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if\r\nit were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I\r\nam awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so\r\nhot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually\r\nbeing wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and\r\nwakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been\r\nsuddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously\r\nill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch\r\nher looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely\r\nrose-pink. She has lost that an\u00e6mic look which she had. I pray it will\r\nall last.",

I look at that last letter of his, but\r\nsomehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is\r\nhis writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in\r\nher sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her\r\nwhich I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching\r\nme. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room\r\nsearching for the key.",
    "_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting\r\ndreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should\r\nfeel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last\r\nletter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable\r\nthan ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and\r\nthe fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and\r\nlearn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is\r\nhidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except\r\nthe green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;\r\ngrey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the\r\ngrey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea\r\nis tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,\r\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey\r\nmist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and\r\nthere is a \"brool\" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.\r\nDark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in\r\nthe mist, and seem \"men like trees walking.\" The fishing-boats are\r\nracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into\r\nthe harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is\r\nmaking straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that\r\nhe wants to talk....",

    "\"I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked\r\nthings I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;\r\nbut I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We\r\naud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't\r\naltogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it;\r\nan' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my\r\nown heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a\r\nbit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at\r\nhand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to\r\nexpect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his\r\nscythe. Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at\r\nonce; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of\r\nDeath will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye dooal an' greet, my\r\ndeary!\"--for he saw that I was crying--\"if he should come this very\r\nnight I'd not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a\r\nwaitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that\r\nwe can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my\r\ndeary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be lookin' and\r\nwonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with\r\nit loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!\" he\r\ncried suddenly. \"There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont\r\nthat sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the\r\nair; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call\r\ncomes!\" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth\r\nmoved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got\r\nup, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled\r\noff. It all touched me, and upset me very much.",
    "I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his\r\narm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time\r\nkept looking at a strange ship.",
    "\"I can't make her out,\" he said; \"she's a Russian, by the look of her;\r\nbut she's knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn't know her mind\r\na bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to\r\nrun up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is\r\nsteered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel;\r\nchanges about with every puff of wind. We'll hear more of her before\r\nthis time to-morrow.\"",
    "CUTTING FROM \"THE DAILYGRAPH,\" 8 AUGUST",
    "(_Pasted in Mina Murray's Journal._)",
    "From a Correspondent.",
    "_Whitby_.",
    "One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been\r\nexperienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had\r\nbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\r\nAugust. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great\r\nbody of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,\r\nRobin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made\r\ntrips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of\r\n\"tripping\" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the\r\nafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\r\nchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\r\nsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of\r\n\"mares'-tails\" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then\r\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\r\nlanguage is ranked \"No. 2: light breeze.\" The coastguard on duty at once\r\nmade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has\r\nkept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic\r\nmanner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very\r\nbeautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that\r\nthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\r\nchurchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black\r\nmass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\r\ndownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\r\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and\r\nthere masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all\r\nsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The\r\nexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the\r\nsketches of the \"Prelude to the Great Storm\" will grace the R. A. and R.\r\nI. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and\r\nthere that his \"cobble\" or his \"mule,\" as they term the different\r\nclasses of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.\r\nThe wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\r\nwas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\r\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There\r\nwere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\r\nwhich usually \"hug\" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\r\nfew fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign\r\nschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The\r\nfoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\r\ncomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\r\nher to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she\r\nwas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\r\nswell of the sea,",
    "\"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\"",
    "Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite\r\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\r\ninland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the\r\nband on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the\r\ngreat harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a\r\nstrange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\r\ncarry a strange, faint, hollow booming.",
    "Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the\r\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,\r\nthe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in\r\ngrowing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\r\nthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.\r\nWhite-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\r\nshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept\r\nthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier\r\nof Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such\r\nforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,\r\nor clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary\r\nto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the\r\nfatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to\r\nthe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\r\ndrifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,\r\nso dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of\r\nimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\r\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many\r\na one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist\r\ncleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the\r\nlightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals\r\nof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock\r\nof the footsteps of the storm.",
    "Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of\r\nabsorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with\r\neach wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to\r\nsnatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with\r\na rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\r\nthe white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\r\nCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been\r\ntried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in\r\nthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\r\nOnce or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\r\nwith gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\r\nof the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\r\npiers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\r\njoy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\r\nto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.",
    "Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\r\nwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed\r\nearlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,\r\nand there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they\r\nrealized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the\r\nport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time\r\nto time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\r\nit would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\r\nharbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\r\ngreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\r\nvisible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\r\nspeed that, in the words of one old salt, \"she must fetch up somewhere,\r\nif it was only in hell.\" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\r\nany hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\r\nlike a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\r\nfor the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\r\nbooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\r\nthan before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\r\nmouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\r\nbreathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\r\nof the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\r\nthe piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\r\nswept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\r\ngained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\r\nshudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\r\ncorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\r\nmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\r\nawe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\r\nfound the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\r\nall took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\r\nschooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\r\nthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\r\nstorms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\r\nCliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.",
    "There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\r\nthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\r\n\"top-hammer\" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\r\nthe shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\r\nif shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\r\non the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\r\nhangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\r\ntombstones--\"thruff-steans\" or \"through-stones,\" as they call them in\r\nthe Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\r\nhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\r\nintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.",
    "It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\r\nall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\r\nout on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\r\nside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\r\nfirst to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\r\nthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\r\nlight on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\r\nwhen he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\r\nonce as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\r\ncuriosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\r\nround from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\r\ncorrespondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\r\nWhen I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\r\nwhom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\r\ncourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\r\nto climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\r\nwhilst actually lashed to the wheel.",
    "It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\r\nnot often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\r\nby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\r\nthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\r\nwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\r\nthe binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\r\nthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\r\nthe wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\r\nwas tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\r\nstate of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\r\nPlace--who came immediately after me, declared, after making\r\nexamination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\r\npocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\r\npaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\r\nthe man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\r\nteeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\r\ncomplications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot\r\nclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a\r\nderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young\r\nlaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already\r\ncompletely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the\r\nstatutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\r\ndelegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say\r\nthat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where\r\nhe held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as\r\nnoble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to\r\nawait inquest.",
    "Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;\r\ncrowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over\r\nthe Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further\r\ndetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into\r\nharbour in the storm.",
    "_Whitby_",
    "_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\r\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It\r\nturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the\r\n_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a\r\nsmall amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.\r\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of\r\n7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took\r\npossession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,\r\nacting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and\r\npaid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except\r\nthe strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been\r\nmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with\r\nexisting regulations. As the matter is to be a \"nine days' wonder,\" they\r\nare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after\r\ncomplaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which\r\nlanded when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the\r\nS. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\r\nanimal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;\r\nit seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it\r\nwas frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still\r\nhiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a\r\npossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\r\nis evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\r\nmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\r\ndead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,\r\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,\r\nand its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\r\npermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order\r\nup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest\r\nexcept as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is\r\nwith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced\r\nat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them\r\nunfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for\r\nconcealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a\r\nrescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and\r\nsupercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with\r\nsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that\r\nthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my\r\nstatement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the\r\ndictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for\r\nme, time being short.",

On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,\r\nand ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind\r\nIt, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the\r\nair.\" And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into\r\nspace. Then he went on: \"But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the\r\nhold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and\r\nsee. You work the helm.\" And, with a warning look and his finger on his\r\nlip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could\r\nnot leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest\r\nand a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,\r\nraving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those\r\nbig boxes: they are invoiced as \"clay,\" and to pull them about is as\r\nharmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and\r\nwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.\r\nThen, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut\r\ndown sails and lie by, and signal for help....",

His horror turned to despair, and in\r\na steady voice he said: \"You had better come too, captain, before it is\r\ntoo late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me\r\nfrom Him, and it is all that is left!\" Before I could say a word, or\r\nmove forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately\r\nthrew himself into the sea.

    "_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most\r\ntouching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin\r\nwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the\r\nchurchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst\r\nthe cort\u00e8ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down\r\nagain. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.\r\nThe poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on\r\nit when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.\r\nShe was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that\r\nher dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:\r\nshe will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if\r\nthere be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional\r\ncause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our\r\nseat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,\r\nfallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of\r\nfear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor\r\ndear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so\r\nsweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other\r\npeople do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did\r\nnot much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men\r\nwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.\r\nThe dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw\r\nthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would\r\nnot come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few\r\nyards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then\r\nharshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a\r\nnoise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs\r\nbristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally\r\nthe man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then\r\ntook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on\r\nthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the\r\nstone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did\r\nnot try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was\r\nin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,\r\nto comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to\r\ntouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly\r\nfear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world\r\nwithout trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The\r\nwhole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead\r\nman; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the\r\ntouching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all\r\nafford material for her dreams.",
    "I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I\r\nshall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and\r\nback. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.",

    "_Same day, 11 o'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I\r\nhad made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely\r\nwalk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some\r\ndear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,\r\nand frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything\r\nexcept, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean\r\nand give us a fresh start. We had a capital \"severe tea\" at Robin Hood's\r\nBay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over\r\nthe seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have\r\nshocked the \"New Woman\" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless\r\nthem! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,\r\nand with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was\r\nreally tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.\r\nThe young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay\r\nfor supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I\r\nknow it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that\r\nsome day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new\r\nclass of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be\r\npressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and\r\nbreathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and\r\nlooks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her\r\nonly in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.\r\nSome of the \"New Women\" writers will some day start an idea that men and\r\nwomen should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or\r\naccepting. But I suppose the New Woman won't condescend in future to\r\naccept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make\r\nof it, too! There's some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,\r\nbecause dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the\r\ncorner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be\r\nquite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.",

    "_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.\r\nI am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an\r\nagonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....\r\nSuddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear\r\nupon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,\r\nso I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed\r\nwas empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The\r\ndoor was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her\r\nmother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some\r\nclothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it\r\nstruck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her\r\ndreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.\r\nDressing-gown and dress were both in their places. \"Thank God,\" I said\r\nto myself, \"she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.\" I ran\r\ndownstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in\r\nall the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear\r\nchilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It\r\nwas not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people\r\nof the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that\r\nLucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what\r\nmight happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a\r\nbig, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the\r\nCrescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North\r\nTerrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At\r\nthe edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to\r\nthe East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing Lucy\r\nin our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,\r\ndriving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of\r\nlight and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see\r\nnothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all\r\naround it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey\r\ncoming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as\r\na sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually\r\nvisible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for\r\nthere, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a\r\nhalf-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too\r\nquick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost\r\nimmediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind\r\nthe seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,\r\nwhether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another\r\nglance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the\r\nfish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East\r\nCliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced\r\nthat it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition. The\r\ntime and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath\r\ncame laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have\r\ngone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with\r\nlead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost\r\nto the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now\r\nclose enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There\r\nwas undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the\r\nhalf-reclining white figure. I called in fright, \"Lucy! Lucy!\" and\r\nsomething raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face\r\nand red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the\r\nentrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and\r\nthe seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in\r\nview again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\r\nthat I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\r\nof the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living\r\nthing about.",
    "When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips\r\nwere parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in\r\nlong, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\r\nbreath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the\r\ncollar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so\r\nthere came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I\r\nflung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\r\nfor I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,\r\nunclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to\r\nhave my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her\r\nthroat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety\r\nand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\r\nbecame quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I\r\nhad her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began\r\nvery gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she\r\nbecame more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing\r\noccasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other\r\nreasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\r\ntill finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised\r\nto see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.\r\nLucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\r\nhave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\r\nunclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She\r\ntrembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\r\nme home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we\r\npassed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She\r\nstopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.\r\nHowever, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\r\nwas a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\r\nmud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no\r\none, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.",
    "Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw\r\na man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of\r\nus; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as\r\nthere are here, steep little closes, or \"wynds,\" as they call them in\r\nScotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I\r\nshould faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\r\nhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation\r\nin case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our\r\nfeet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into\r\nbed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a\r\nword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I\r\nhesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her\r\nmother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\r\nand thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,\r\ninfallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\r\nso. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to\r\nmy wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping\r\nsoundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....",

    "_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed\r\nnot to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not\r\nseem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she\r\nlooks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to\r\nnotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might\r\nhave been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have\r\npinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are\r\ntwo little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress\r\nwas a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she\r\nlaughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it\r\ncannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.",

    "_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the\r\nsun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave\r\nWoods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the\r\ncliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for\r\nI could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had\r\nJonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening\r\nwe strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr\r\nand Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she\r\nhas been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door\r\nand secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any\r\ntrouble to-night.",

    "_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I\r\nwas wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to\r\nbe a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed\r\nunder a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds\r\nchirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,\r\nwas even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of\r\nmanner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me\r\nand told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about\r\nJonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded\r\nsomewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make\r\nthem more bearable.",

    "_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as\r\nbefore. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,\r\nstill asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling\r\naside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft\r\neffect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,\r\nsilent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight\r\nflitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or\r\ntwice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,\r\nand flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back\r\nfrom the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.\r\nShe did not stir again all night.",

    "_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems\r\nto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to\r\nget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or\r\ndinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for\r\ndinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and\r\nstopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low\r\ndown in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was\r\nthrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe\r\neverything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and\r\nsuddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--",
    "\"His red eyes again! They are just the same.\" It was such an odd\r\nexpression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I\r\nslewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare\r\nat her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on\r\nher face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but\r\nfollowed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,\r\nwhereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,\r\nfor it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like\r\nburning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red\r\nsunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our\r\nseat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the\r\nrefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I\r\ncalled Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself\r\nwith a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she\r\nwas thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I\r\nsaid nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went\r\nearly to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;\r\nI walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet\r\nsadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then\r\nbright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the\r\nCrescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance\r\nup at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I thought that\r\nperhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and\r\nwaved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,\r\nthe moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell\r\non the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against\r\nthe side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and\r\nby her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a\r\ngood-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,\r\nbut as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast\r\nasleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,\r\nas though to protect it from cold.",
    "I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the\r\ndoor is locked and the window securely fastened.",
    "She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and\r\nthere is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I\r\nfear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it\r\nis.",

We had a happy surprise at breakfast.\r\nArthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy\r\nis full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on\r\nin the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her\r\nvery own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to\r\nprotect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got\r\nher death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;\r\nher doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for\r\nher heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be\r\nalmost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of\r\nthe dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.",

I do not understand Lucy's\r\nfading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys\r\nthe fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and\r\nshe gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping\r\nas if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at\r\nnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open\r\nwindow. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I\r\ntried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to\r\nrestore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,\r\npainful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the\r\nwindow she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may\r\nnot be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat\r\njust now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.\r\nThey are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the\r\nedges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with\r\nred centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the\r\ndoctor seeing about them.",

    "_18 August._--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the\r\nchurchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all\r\nnight, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already\r\nto her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she\r\nwere in any way an\u00e6mic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in\r\ngay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence\r\nseems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I\r\nneeded any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this\r\nvery seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with\r\nthe heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--",
    "\"My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.\r\nSwales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up\r\nGeordie.\" As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she\r\nhad dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered\r\nlook came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her\r\nhabit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she\r\nwent on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to\r\nherself:--",
    "\"I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be\r\nhere in this spot--I don't know why, for I was afraid of something--I\r\ndon't know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing\r\nthrough the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and\r\nI leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the\r\nwhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as\r\nI went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and\r\ndark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very\r\nsweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking\r\ninto deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have\r\nheard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away\r\nfrom me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.\r\nI seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,\r\nand then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an\r\nearthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body.

    "_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About\r\neight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when\r\nsetting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest\r\nin him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the\r\nattendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was\r\nquite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he\r\nwould say was:--",
    "\"I don't want to talk to you: you don't count now; the Master is at\r\n     hand.\"",
    "The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has\r\nseized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with\r\nhomicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The\r\ncombination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock I visited him myself. His\r\nattitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime\r\nself-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him\r\nas nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that\r\nhe himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man\r\nare too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves\r\naway! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created\r\nfrom human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,\r\nif men only knew!",
    "For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and\r\ngreater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict\r\nobservation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his\r\neyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it\r\nthe shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to\r\nknow so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his\r\nbed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I\r\nwould find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to\r\nlead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite\r\nhis attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--",
    "\"Bother them all! I don't care a pin about them.\"",
    "\"What?\" I said. \"You don't mean to tell me you don't care about\r\nspiders?\" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling\r\nup with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--",
    "\"The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;\r\nbut when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes\r\nthat are filled.\"",

    "_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had\r\nlain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the\r\nnight-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield\r\nhad escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is\r\ntoo dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might\r\nwork out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.\r\nHe said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his\r\nbed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His\r\nattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He\r\nran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once\r\nsent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.\r\nThe attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should\r\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out\r\nof the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through\r\nthe window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,\r\nand, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The\r\nattendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a\r\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt\r\nof trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our\r\ngrounds from those of the deserted house.",
    "I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men\r\nimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend\r\nmight be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,\r\ndropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield's figure just\r\ndisappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the\r\nfar side of the house I found him pressed close against the old\r\nironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some\r\none, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest\r\nI might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of\r\nbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping\r\nis upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not\r\ntake note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to\r\nhim--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him\r\nin. I heard him say:--",
    "\"I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will\r\nreward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar\r\noff. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass\r\nme by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?\"",
    "He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes\r\neven when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a\r\nstartling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.\r\nHe is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I\r\nnever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I\r\nshall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and\r\nhis danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he\r\nmight have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any\r\nrate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat\r\nthat keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded\r\nroom. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are\r\nmore deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.",
    "Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--",
    "\"I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!\"",
    "So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this\r\ndiary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.",

    "\"My dearest Lucy,--",
    "\"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we\r\nparted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull\r\nall right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I\r\nfeel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I\r\nknew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some\r\nnursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,\r\noh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out\r\nof his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his\r\nface has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not\r\nremember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At\r\nleast, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some\r\nterrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try\r\nto recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,\r\ntells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I\r\nwanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,\r\nand say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the\r\nsecrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear\r\nthem, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the\r\nnext day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,\r\nand after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved\r\nabout, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about\r\nanything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,\r\nhave no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes\r\nto you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can\r\ntreat of.' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my\r\npoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of\r\n_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I\r\nfelt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a\r\ncause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his\r\nface while he sleeps. He is waking!...",
    "\"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something\r\nfrom the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.\r\nI saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to\r\nlet me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his\r\ntrouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent\r\nme over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.\r\nThen he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the\r\nnote-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--",
    "\"'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has\r\nnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,\r\ndear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no\r\nsecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to\r\nthink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it\r\nwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain\r\nfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to\r\nknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my\r\ndear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are\r\ncomplete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is\r\nthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me\r\nknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to\r\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fell\r\nback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I\r\nhave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this\r\nafternoon, and am waiting her reply....",

Please God, I\r\nshall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities\r\nI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the\r\nchaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it\r\nis the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alone\r\nwith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it\r\nup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon\r\nwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,\r\nand for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it\r\nto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would\r\nbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each\r\nother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake\r\nor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,\r\nLucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it\r\nwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go\r\nthrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to\r\nhave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I\r\nshall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the\r\nyear.",
    "\"Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the\r\nhappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him\r\nexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love\r\nand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,\r\nand drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn\r\npledge between us....",
    "\"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because\r\nit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to\r\nme. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from\r\nthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,\r\nand with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that\r\nin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,\r\nplease Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of\r\nsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must\r\nnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be\r\n_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear.

It will be a\r\npainful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and\r\nI must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at\r\nHillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in\r\nMrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being\r\nalone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I\r\nam filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I\r\ncan after you have seen her. Do not fail!",

    "\"My dear old fellow,--",
    "\"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once\r\nthat in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady\r\nthat I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with\r\nher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw\r\nher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full\r\nopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship\r\nmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can\r\nbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to\r\ndraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have\r\ndone and propose doing.",
    "\"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,\r\nand in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew\r\nto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no\r\ndoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.\r\nWe lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we\r\ngot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness\r\namongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with\r\nme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,\r\nfor the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,\r\nhowever, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair\r\nwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her\r\nhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to\r\nmake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--",
    "\"'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her\r\nthat a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously\r\nanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that\r\nmatter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for\r\nmyself, but all for him!' So I am quite free.",
    "\"I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see\r\nthe usual an\u00e6mic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the\r\nquality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord\r\ngave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a\r\nslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured\r\na few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative\r\nanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in\r\nitself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite\r\nsatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a\r\ncause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something\r\nmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at\r\ntimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but\r\nregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she\r\nused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,\r\nand that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where\r\nMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not\r\nreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I\r\nhave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of\r\nAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the\r\nworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things\r\nwere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your\r\nrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to\r\nyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for\r\nher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal\r\nreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his\r\nwishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows\r\nwhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher\r\nand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;\r\nand he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron\r\nnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,\r\nself-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the\r\nkindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the\r\nnoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and\r\npractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I\r\ntell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in\r\nhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra\r\nto-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not\r\nalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.",

    "\"My dear Art,--",
    "\"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and\r\nfound that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that\r\nwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of\r\nthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of\r\ncourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,\r\nbut says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you\r\ntrust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.\r\nTell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not\r\njesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked\r\nwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had\r\ncome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his\r\nreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not\r\nbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his\r\nbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the\r\ntime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of\r\nour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for\r\n_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the\r\nsmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a\r\nstudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make\r\nit. In any case I am to have a letter.",
    "\"Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first\r\nsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the\r\nghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was\r\nvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him\r\nfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard\r\nstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick\r\nlook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of\r\nall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite\r\ngeniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into\r\nreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation\r\ngently round to his visit, and suavely said:--",
    "\"'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so\r\nmuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not\r\nsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a\r\nghastly pale. To them I say: \"Pouf!\"' And he snapped his fingers at me\r\nand went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can\r\nhe'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with\r\nwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a\r\nparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything\r\nof a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them\r\nback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,\r\noh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the\r\nyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell\r\nthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many\r\nsorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to\r\nsmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all\r\nto ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the\r\nprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but\r\nsaid: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional\r\ncause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has\r\nbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way an\u00e6mic. I have\r\nasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,\r\nthat so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.\r\nAnd yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go\r\nback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if\r\nthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well\r\nis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me\r\ntoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'",
    "\"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.\r\nAnd so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust\r\nyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my\r\ndear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who\r\nare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and\r\nyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to\r\ncome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from\r\nme.\"",

    "_4 September._--Zo\u00f6phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.\r\nHe had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just\r\nbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew\r\nthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a\r\nrun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so\r\nviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five\r\nminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank\r\ninto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The\r\nattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really\r\nappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the\r\nother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite\r\nunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was\r\nsome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and\r\nas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,\r\nwoe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show\r\nsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on\r\nhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He\r\nwas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture\r\nby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of\r\npadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad\r\nconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to\r\nhis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to\r\nhumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the\r\nsugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a\r\nharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a\r\nbox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find\r\na spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any\r\nclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not\r\nrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of\r\nfar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--",
    "\"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do\r\nit for myself!\" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:\r\n\"Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more\r\nsugar? I think it would be good for me.\"",
    "\"And the flies?\" I said.",
    "\"Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like\r\nit.\" And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do\r\nnot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man\r\nas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,\r\nwhom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our\r\nown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As\r\nhis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in\r\nthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky\r\nbeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows\r\nand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul\r\nwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone\r\nbuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart\r\nto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from\r\nhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less\r\nfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an\r\ninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual\r\nrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up\r\nquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to\r\nhold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight\r\nover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his\r\nfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut\r\nthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised\r\nme, so I asked him: \"Are you not going to keep flies any more?\"",
    "\"No,\" said he; \"I am sick of all that rubbish!\" He certainly is a\r\nwonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his\r\nmind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue\r\nafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon\r\nand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at\r\nperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?\r\nWe shall see.",

    "_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at\r\nLiverpool Street was:--",
    "\"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?\"",
    "\"No,\" I said. \"I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I\r\nwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss\r\nWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.\"",
    "\"Right, my friend,\" he said, \"quite right! Better he not know as yet;\r\nperhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he\r\nshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal\r\nwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch\r\nas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,\r\ntoo--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why\r\nyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge\r\nin its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it\r\nand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.\" He\r\ntouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself\r\nthe same way. \"I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall\r\nunfold to you.\"",
    "\"Why not now?\" I asked. \"It may do some good; we may arrive at some\r\ndecision.\" He stopped and looked at me, and said:--",
    "\"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has\r\nripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine\r\nhas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the\r\near and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,\r\nand say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when the\r\ntime comes.'\" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply\r\nhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as\r\nhe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: \"The good husbandman tell\r\nyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the\r\ngood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for\r\nthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of\r\nthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,\r\nand Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,\r\nthere's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.\" He broke\r\noff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very\r\ngravely:--",
    "\"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more\r\nfull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and\r\nI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that\r\nknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.\r\nEven if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this\r\ncase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such\r\ninterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the\r\nbeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too\r\nsmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.\r\nHereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We\r\nlearn from failure, not from success!\"",
    "When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely\r\nmore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a\r\nbag in which were many instruments and drugs, \"the ghastly paraphernalia\r\nof our beneficial trade,\" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the\r\nequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,\r\nMrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I\r\nexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained\r\nthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case\r\nwhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some\r\ncause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her\r\ndaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is\r\nsomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an\r\nenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that\r\nwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered\r\nselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice\r\nof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have\r\nknowledge of.",
    "I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down\r\na rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness\r\nmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that\r\nI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were\r\nshown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I\r\nwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the\r\nred seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of\r\nher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or\r\nhear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged\r\ntill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not\r\nseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then\r\nVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The\r\ninstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to\r\nthe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and\r\nclosed the door. \"My God!\" he said; \"this is dreadful. There is no time\r\nto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's\r\naction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is\r\nit you or me?\"",
    "\"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.\"",
    "\"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.\"",
    "I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\r\nthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the\r\ndoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in\r\nan eager whisper:--",
    "\"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and\r\nhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\r\nmyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,\r\nsir, for coming.\" When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had\r\nbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\r\nhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\r\nseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to\r\nhim gravely as he held out his hand:--",
    "\"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is\r\nbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.\" For he\r\nsuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. \"You are to\r\nhelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\r\nbest help.\"",
    "\"What can I do?\" asked Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me, and I shall do it. My\r\nlife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\r\nher.\" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\r\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--",
    "\"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!\"",
    "\"What shall I do?\" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril\r\nquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. \"Come!\"\r\nhe said. \"You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than\r\nme, better than my friend John.\" Arthur looked bewildered, and the\r\nProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--",
    "\"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have\r\nor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\r\nwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\r\nthe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is\r\nthe more young and strong than me\"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\r\nit hard in silence--\"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,\r\nold or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not\r\nso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!\" Arthur turned to him\r\nand said:--",
    "\"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\r\nunderstand----\"",
    "He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.",
    "\"Good boy!\" said Van Helsing. \"In the not-so-far-off you will be happy\r\nthat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You\r\nshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\r\nmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\r\nher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!\"",
    "We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.\r\nLucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not\r\nasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke\r\nto us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\r\nthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and\r\ncoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--",
    "\"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good\r\nchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.\" She had made\r\nthe effort with success.",
    "It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked\r\nthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to\r\nflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\r\nits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was\r\nsatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\r\ncoat. Then he added: \"You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\r\nover the table. Friend John, help to me!\" So neither of us looked whilst\r\nhe bent over her.",
    "Van Helsing turning to me, said:",
    "\"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\r\ndefibrinate it.\"",
    "Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the\r\noperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come\r\nback to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy\r\nof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow\r\nanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\r\nwas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must\r\nhave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.\r\nBut the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\r\nhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own\r\nheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: \"Do not stir an instant.\r\nIt is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.\" When all was over I\r\ncould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his\r\narm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\r\nman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--",
    "\"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have\r\npresently.\" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\r\npillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band\r\nwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\r\ndiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\r\nand showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I\r\ncould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's\r\nways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\r\nme, saying: \"Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\r\nwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep\r\nmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\r\nhis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,\r\nthat you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways\r\nthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you\r\ncan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell\r\nher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\r\nhave done. Good-bye.\"",
    "When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,\r\nbut her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\r\nbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.\r\nThe velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a\r\nwhisper:--",
    "\"What do you make of that mark on her throat?\"",
    "\"What do you make of it?\"",
    "\"I have not examined it yet,\" I answered, and then and there proceeded\r\nto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two\r\npunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of\r\ndisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\r\ntrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\r\nwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\r\nthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed\r\nwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must\r\nhave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.",
    "\"Well?\" said Van Helsing.",
    "\"Well,\" said I, \"I can make nothing of it.\" The Professor stood up. \"I\r\nmust go back to Amsterdam to-night,\" he said. \"There are books and\r\nthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you\r\nmust not let your sight pass from her.\"",
    "\"Shall I have a nurse?\" I asked.",
    "\"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that\r\nshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all\r\nthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as\r\npossible. And then we may begin.\"",
    "\"May begin?\" I said. \"What on earth do you mean?\"",
    "\"We shall see!\" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment\r\nlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held\r\nup:--",
    "\"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you\r\nshall not sleep easy hereafter!\"",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued._",
    "_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself\r\noff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being\r\nfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,\r\nand she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the\r\nabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra\r\nthat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she\r\nalmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed\r\nstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made\r\npreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the\r\nnight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by\r\nthe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\r\ngratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed\r\nsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\r\nand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort\r\nand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she\r\ndid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--",
    "\"You do not want to go to sleep?\"",
    "\"No; I am afraid.\"",
    "\"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.\"",
    "\"Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!\"",
    "\"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?\"",
    "\"I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All\r\nthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.\"",
    "\"But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and\r\nI can promise that nothing will happen.\"",
    "\"Ah, I can trust you!\" I seized the opportunity, and said: \"I promise\r\nyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.\"",
    "\"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will\r\nsleep!\" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank\r\nback, asleep.",
    "All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on\r\nin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were\r\nslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a\r\npendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad\r\ndreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.",
    "In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took\r\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short\r\nwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result\r\nof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all\r\nday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my\r\nzo\u00f6phagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the\r\npast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst\r\nI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as\r\nit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the\r\nnight mail and would join me early in the morning.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to\r\nHillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my\r\nbrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral\r\nexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands\r\nwith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--",
    "\"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well\r\nagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who\r\nwill sit up with you.\" I would not argue the point, but went and had my\r\nsupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I\r\nmade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than\r\nexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next\r\nher own, where a cozy fire was burning. \"Now,\" she said, \"you must stay\r\nhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the\r\nsofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to\r\nbed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I\r\nshall call out, and you can come to me at once.\" I could not but\r\nacquiesce, for I was \"dog-tired,\" and could not have sat up had I tried.\r\nSo, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,\r\nI lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.",
    "_Lucy Westenra's Diary._",
    "_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,\r\nthat to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after\r\na long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,\r\nvery close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose\r\nit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner\r\neyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love\r\nrein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know\r\nwhere my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears\r\nmust tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of\r\nlast night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.\r\nAnd to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and\r\nwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!\r\nGood-night, Arthur.",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and\r\nstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn\r\nin an asylum, at any rate.",
    "\"And how is our patient?\"",
    "\"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,\" I answered.",
    "\"Come, let us see,\" he said. And together we went into the room.",
    "The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van\r\nHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.",
    "As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I\r\nheard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a\r\ndeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and\r\nhis exclamation of horror, \"Gott in Himmel!\" needed no enforcement from\r\nhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his\r\niron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.",
    "There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly\r\nwhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums\r\nseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a\r\ncorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp\r\nin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit\r\nstood to him, and he put it down again softly. \"Quick!\" he said. \"Bring\r\nthe brandy.\" I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.\r\nHe wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and\r\nwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising\r\nsuspense said:--",
    "\"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is\r\nundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have\r\nto call on you yourself this time, friend John.\" As he spoke, he was\r\ndipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I\r\nhad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no\r\npossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did\r\nnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no\r\nmatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing\r\nheld up a warning finger. \"Do not stir,\" he said, \"but I fear that with\r\ngrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much\r\ndanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection\r\nof morphia.\" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his\r\nintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge\r\nsubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride\r\nthat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid\r\ncheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to\r\nfeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.",
    "The Professor watched me critically. \"That will do,\" he said. \"Already?\"\r\nI remonstrated. \"You took a great deal more from Art.\" To which he\r\nsmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--",
    "\"He is her lover, her _fianc\u00e9_. You have work, much work, to do for her\r\nand for others; and the present will suffice.\"",
    "When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\r\ndigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his\r\nleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by\r\nhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for\r\nmyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\r\nwhispered:--",
    "\"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up\r\nunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and\r\nenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!\"",
    "When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--",
    "\"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and\r\nrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.\"",
    "I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I\r\nhad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I\r\nfelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\r\nwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\r\nand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\r\nshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to\r\nshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,\r\nsleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\r\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\r\nedges--tiny though they were.",
    "Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and\r\nstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing\r\nhad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict\r\ninjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his\r\nvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.",
    "Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything\r\nhad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother\r\ncame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\r\nsaid to me gratefully:--",
    "\"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\r\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale\r\nyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\r\ndo!\" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\r\nfor her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\r\ndrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\r\nimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\r\nlips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.",
    "Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\r\n\"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I\r\nstay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and\r\nI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave\r\nreasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think\r\neven the most not-probable. Good-night.\"",
    "In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of\r\nthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and\r\nwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit\r\nup, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the \"foreign\r\ngentleman.\" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because\r\nI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that\r\ntheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen\r\nsimilar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a\r\nlate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting\r\nfor sleep. It is coming.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van\r\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had\r\narrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it\r\nwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of\r\nwhite flowers.",
    "\"These are for you, Miss Lucy,\" he said.",
    "\"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\"",
    "\"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.\" Here\r\nLucy made a wry face. \"Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or\r\nin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall\r\npoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing\r\nso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,\r\nthat bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but\r\nyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and\r\nhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the\r\nlotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters\r\nof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought\r\nfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late.\"",
    "Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling\r\nthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and\r\nhalf-disgust:--",
    "\"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\r\nthese flowers are only common garlic.\"",
    "To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\r\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--",
    "\"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;\r\nand I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\r\nothers if not for your own.\" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\r\nwell be, he went on more gently: \"Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\r\nme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\r\ncommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\r\nwreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\r\ninquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\r\nand obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\r\nfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall\r\nhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,\r\nwhere my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.\r\nI had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\"",
    "We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's\r\nactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia\r\nthat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\r\nsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\r\nthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\r\nin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\r\nall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\r\nthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\r\npresently I said:--",
    "\"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\r\nthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\r\nwould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\"",
    "\"Perhaps I am!\" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\r\nLucy was to wear round her neck.",
    "We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\r\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\r\nneck. The last words he said to her were:--",
    "\"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\r\nnot to-night open the window or the door.\"",
    "\"I promise,\" said Lucy, \"and thank you both a thousand times for all\r\nyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such\r\nfriends?\"",
    "As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--",
    "\"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,\r\nmuch reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,\r\nand a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early\r\nyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\r\nmore strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!\"",
    "He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights\r\nbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must\r\nhave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but\r\nI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.",
    "_Lucy Westenra's Diary._",
    "_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.\r\nVan Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He\r\npositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been\r\nright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread\r\nbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not\r\nmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I\r\nhave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,\r\nor the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has\r\nfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no\r\ndreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings\r\nnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,\r\nand lying like Ophelia in the play, with \"virgin crants and maiden\r\nstrewments.\" I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!\r\nThere is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,\r\neverybody.",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,\r\nup to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The\r\nProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.",
    "Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at\r\neight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the\r\nfresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's\r\nannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,\r\nbut had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met\r\nMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early\r\nriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--",
    "\"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still\r\nasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I\r\nshould disturb her.\" The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He\r\nrubbed his hands together, and said:--",
    "\"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,\" to\r\nwhich she answered:--",
    "\"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this\r\nmorning is due in part to me.\"",
    "\"How you do mean, ma'am?\" asked the Professor.",
    "\"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into\r\nher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did\r\nnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\r\nhorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\r\na bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\r\ntoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\r\nand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be\r\npleased with her, I am sure.\"",
    "She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As\r\nshe had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen\r\ngrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\r\nwas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\r\nhe actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\r\nher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and\r\nforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.",
    "Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He\r\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat\r\nhis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\r\nand putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\r\nthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\r\nhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \"God! God!\r\nGod!\" he said. \"What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\r\nwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the\r\npagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor\r\nmother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such\r\nthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we\r\nmust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are\r\nbeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!\" Suddenly he\r\njumped to his feet. \"Come,\" he said, \"come, we must see and act. Devils\r\nor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him\r\nall the same.\" He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we\r\nwent up to Lucy's room.",
    "Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.\r\nThis time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same\r\nawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and\r\ninfinite pity.",
    "\"As I expected,\" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which\r\nmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then\r\nbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another\r\noperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the\r\nnecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\r\nwarning hand. \"No!\" he said. \"To-day you must operate. I shall provide.\r\nYou are weakened already.\" As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled\r\nup his shirt-sleeve.",
    "Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to\r\nthe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I\r\nwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.",
    "Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must\r\nnot remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the\r\nflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour\r\nwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case\r\nhimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would\r\nsend me word when to come.",
    "After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and\r\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.",
    "What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life\r\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.",

    "_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong\r\nagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some\r\nlong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and\r\nfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim\r\nhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness\r\nin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress\r\nmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to\r\nlife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,\r\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems\r\nto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my\r\nwits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed\r\nso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and\r\ncommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now\r\nwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown\r\nquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from\r\nHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a\r\nday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left\r\nalone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our\r\nfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for\r\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found\r\nhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,\r\nalthough the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against\r\nthe window-panes.",

    "After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using\r\nthe words \"Pall Mall Gazette\" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find\r\nthe keeper of the section of the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens in which the wolf\r\ndepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in\r\nthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to\r\nhis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,\r\nelderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their\r\nhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty\r\ncomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called \"business\"\r\nuntil the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the\r\ntable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--",
    "\"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose me\r\nrefoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the\r\nwolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore\r\nI begins to arsk them questions.\"",

Mind you,\" he added philosophically, \"there's a deal of\r\nthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' and\r\narskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that\r\nonly for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd\r\nanswer.

I\r\nweren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owl\r\nas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, now\r\nthat the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsed\r\nme out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch\r\nmy ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.\r\nDrive along with your questions.

    "\"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it\r\nhappened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you\r\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will\r\nend.\"",
    "\"All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolf\r\nwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from\r\nNorway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a\r\nnice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm more\r\nsurprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the\r\nplace. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women.\"",
    "\"Don't you mind him, sir!\" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \"'E's\r\ngot mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf\r\n'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im.\"",
    "\"Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first\r\nhear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for a\r\nyoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem\r\naway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the\r\nbars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about that\r\nday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook\r\nnose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. He\r\nhad a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,\r\nfor it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad white\r\nkid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:\r\n'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'",
    "\"'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give\r\n'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind\r\nof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, they\r\nwouldn't like me,' 'e says.",
    "\"'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a\r\nbone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as a\r\nbagful.'",
    "\"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they\r\nlay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears\r\nsame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put\r\nin his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!",
    "\"'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'",
    "\"'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'",
    "\"'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a\r\nman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.",
    "\"'No,' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of\r\nseveral.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks\r\naway. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,\r\nand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole\r\nhevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves\r\nhere all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.\r\nThere warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a\r\ndog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice\r\nI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling\r\nstopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore\r\nturnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's\r\ncage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And\r\nthat's all I know for certing.\"",
    "\"Did any one else see anything?\"",
    "\"One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,\r\nwhen he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At\r\nleast, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e\r\nnever said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was\r\nonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all\r\nnight-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'\r\nanything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead.\"",
    "\"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the\r\nwolf?\"",
    "\"Well, sir,\" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \"I think I can;\r\nbut I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory.\"",
    "\"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from\r\nexperience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?\"",
    "\"Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'ere\r\nwolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.\"",
    "From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I\r\ncould see that it had done service before, and that the whole\r\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinage\r\nwith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,\r\nso I said:--",
    "\"Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,\r\nand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me\r\nwhat you think will happen.\"",
    "\"Right y'are, sir,\" he said briskly. \"Ye'll excoose me, I know, for\r\na-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much\r\nas telling me to go on.\"",
    "\"Well, I never!\" said the old lady.",
    "\"My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. The\r\ngard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward faster\r\nthan a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,\r\nwolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that\r\nway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets\r\nin packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is\r\nthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,\r\nLor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so\r\nclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in\r\n'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for\r\nhisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an'\r\na-shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to get\r\nhis breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in a\r\ncoal-cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his\r\ngreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he's\r\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's\r\nshop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf with\r\na soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I\r\nshouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's\r\nall.\"",
    "I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\r\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length\r\nwith surprise.",
    "\"God bless me!\" he said. \"If there ain't old Bersicker come back by\r\n'isself!\"",
    "He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it\r\nseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so\r\nwell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a\r\npersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.",
    "After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor\r\nhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal\r\nitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all\r\npicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her\r\nconfidence in masquerade.",
    "The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The\r\nwicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the\r\nchildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of\r\npenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine\r\nprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\r\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--",

    "_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my\r\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,\r\nhad fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in\r\nrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was\r\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\r\ninto the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's\r\npause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,\r\nas I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was\r\ntoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my\r\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.\r\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was\r\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a\r\nlittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not\r\nintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,\r\nkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the\r\nattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment\r\npositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking\r\nup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was\r\neasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite\r\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: \"The blood is the life!\r\nThe blood is the life!\"",
    "I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of\r\nlate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's\r\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me.

    "I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.\r\nVan Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.",
    "I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that\r\nsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I\r\nknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in\r\nthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have\r\ncalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me\r\nthe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep\r\nwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be\r\nalone, I opened my door and called out: \"Is there anybody there?\" There\r\nwas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.\r\nThen outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but\r\nmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could\r\nsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its\r\nwings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined\r\nnot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;\r\nseeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She\r\nsaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--",
    "\"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all\r\nright.\"",
    "I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in\r\nand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did\r\nnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while\r\nand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in\r\nhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was\r\nstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: \"What is that?\" I tried\r\nto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could\r\nhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was\r\nthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a\r\ncrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\r\nThe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the\r\naperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey\r\nwolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting\r\nposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst\r\nother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing\r\ninsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a\r\nsecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange\r\nand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck\r\nwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a\r\nmoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my\r\neyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole\r\nmyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken\r\nwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that\r\ntravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to\r\nstir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,\r\nwhich seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to\r\nbeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.",
    "The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered\r\nconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the\r\ndogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,\r\nseemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and\r\nstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the\r\nnightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort\r\nme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear\r\ntheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they\r\ncame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay\r\nover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\r\nbroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my\r\ndear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\r\nhad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them\r\nto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew\r\nopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went\r\nin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear\r\nmother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing\r\nhad told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would\r\nhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that\r\nthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went\r\nto the dining-room to look for them.",
    "My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless\r\non the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table\r\nhalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,\r\nand examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the\r\nsideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for\r\nher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back\r\nin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for\r\nthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I\r\ndare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the\r\nbroken window.",
    "The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from\r\nthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God\r\nshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,\r\nwhere they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother\r\ngone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not\r\nsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!",

    "_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\r\nKeeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\r\nand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\r\nmother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\r\nfinding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\r\nthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\r\nhour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but\r\nmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\r\nthe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\r\ndesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\r\ntight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\r\nlate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\r\ndanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\r\nand I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\r\nanywhere.",
    "I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\r\nlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\r\nrapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the\r\ngate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\r\nWhen he saw me, he gasped out:--",
    "\"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\r\nnot get my telegram?\"",
    "I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\r\ntelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\r\nand that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\r\nraised his hat as he said solemnly:--",
    "\"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!\" With his usual\r\nrecuperative energy, he went on: \"Come. If there be no way open to get\r\nin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\"",
    "We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\r\nwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\r\nhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\r\nattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\r\nwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\r\nopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\r\nwas no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at\r\nhand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\r\ndimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\r\nservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\r\nfor their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\r\nroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\r\neach other, and as we moved away he said: \"We can attend to them later.\"\r\nThen we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the\r\ndoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\r\nfaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\r\nroom.",
    "How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\r\nmother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\r\nsheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\r\nbroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\r\nfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\r\ndrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\r\nmother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\r\nwhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\r\nWithout a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\r\npoor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\r\nlistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--",
    "\"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\"",
    "I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\r\nit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\r\non the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\r\nfancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\r\nbut returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\r\noccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\r\nhands. He said to me:--",
    "\"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\r\nFlick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\r\nget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\r\nthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\r\nmore.\"",
    "I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\r\nwomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\r\naffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\r\nsleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\r\nthem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\r\nthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\r\nwas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\r\nMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\r\nas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\r\nboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\r\ngot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\r\nwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\r\nof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\r\nshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\r\nwith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\r\nmust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\r\nand, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.",
    "I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\r\nearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,\r\nand in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\r\nunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--",
    "\"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\r\naway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\" He went\r\non with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.",
    "Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\r\nbe of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\r\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's\r\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\r\na hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--",
    "\"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!\"",
    "We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\r\nher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\r\nthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\r\nstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\r\never seen her.",
    "Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\r\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\r\nout of the room.",
    "\"We must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the\r\nstairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\r\nclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\r\nthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\r\ndeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\r\nobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\r\nenough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved\r\nby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\r\nsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--",
    "\"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\r\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life\r\nwon't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\r\nexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\r\ncourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\r\nveins for her?\"",
    "\"What's the matter with me, anyhow?\"",
    "The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\r\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\r\nHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\r\nglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \"Quincey Morris!\" and\r\nrushed towards him with outstretched hands.",
    "\"What brought you here?\" I cried as our hands met.",
    "\"I guess Art is the cause.\"",
    "He handed me a telegram:--",
    "\"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\r\nCannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\r\nDo not delay.--HOLMWOOD.\"",
    "\"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\r\nme what to do.\"",
    "Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\r\nthe eyes as he said:--",
    "\"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\r\ntrouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\r\nus for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\"",
    "Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\r\nto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\r\ntold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\r\nveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\r\noccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\r\nand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\r\nHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\r\ngood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\r\nwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\r\nto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\r\nafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\r\nbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\r\nLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\r\ntwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\r\nthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\r\nof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\r\nHe handed me the paper saying only: \"It dropped from Lucy's breast when\r\nwe carried her to the bath.\"",
    "When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\r\nasked him: \"In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\r\nmad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\" I was so bewildered that I\r\ndid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\r\npaper, saying:--",
    "\"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\r\nand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\r\nis it that you came to me to say?\" This brought me back to fact, and I\r\nwas all myself again.",
    "\"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\r\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\r\nto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\r\nhad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\r\nknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\r\nhad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\r\nfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\r\nregistrar and go on to the undertaker.\"",
    "\"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\r\nsad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\r\nlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\r\nman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\r\nmore for it! Now go.\"",
    "In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\r\nthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\r\ngoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\r\nwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--",
    "\"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\r\nourselves?\" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\r\nthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\r\nthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.",
    "When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\r\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\r\nsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\r\nside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\r\nexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\r\nSo I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\r\nthe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\r\nrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\r\nto me:--",
    "\"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no\r\nright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\r\nand wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't\r\nhelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong\r\nwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\r\nthat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\r\n_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\r\nNow I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\r\nmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\r\nno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\r\nso?\"",
    "\"That's so,\" I said, and he went on:--",
    "\"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\r\nto-day. Is not that so?\"",
    "\"That's so.\"",
    "\"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\r\nown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\r\nsince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\r\nall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\r\nher in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\r\nwasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\r\nbullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\r\nbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\" As he spoke\r\nthe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\r\nregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\r\nmystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\r\nheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a\r\nroyal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before\r\nanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\r\nProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed\r\nso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\r\nin the same phrase: \"That's so.\"",
    "\"And how long has this been going on?\"",
    "\"About ten days.\"",
    "\"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\r\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\r\nof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it.\" Then,\r\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \"What took it\r\nout?\"",
    "I shook my head. \"That,\" I said, \"is the crux. Van Helsing is simply\r\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.\r\nThere has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\r\nall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall\r\nnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.\" Quincey held\r\nout his hand. \"Count me in,\" he said. \"You and the Dutchman will tell me\r\nwhat to do, and I'll do it.\"",
    "When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel\r\nin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\r\nhad given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had\r\ncome from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van\r\nHelsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,\r\nand seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her\r\npoor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that\r\nmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried\r\nwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but\r\nshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for\r\na long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with\r\nher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell\r\ninto a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she\r\ntook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped\r\nover and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on\r\nwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her\r\nhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering\r\nthe fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as\r\nif in thought, but he said nothing.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\r\nto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and\r\nI took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\r\nunattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew\r\nthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.",
    "When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's\r\nstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\r\nnourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she\r\nslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between\r\nsleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more\r\nhaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale\r\ngums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and\r\nsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently\r\nchanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying\r\none. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.\r\nQuincey went off to meet him at the station.",
    "When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full\r\nand warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more\r\ncolour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking\r\nwith emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,\r\nthe fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had\r\ngrown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible\r\nwere shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a\r\nstimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she\r\nhad done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as\r\ncheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.",
    "It was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with\r\nher. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering\r\nthis on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. I\r\nfear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too\r\ngreat; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.",

Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived\r\nat Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had\r\nan attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there\r\nwere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After\r\ndinner Mr. Hawkins said:--",

    "\"_20 September._",
    "\"My dear Sir,--",
    "\"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of\r\neverything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there\r\nis more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a\r\ndreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended\r\nwith any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men\r\nmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to\r\nwhich, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at\r\nour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was\r\nmyself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and\r\nsaw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of\r\nRenfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called\r\nhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a\r\ndecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \"shut up for a\r\nfoul-mouthed beggar,\" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and\r\nwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to\r\nswing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,\r\nso he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his\r\nmind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless\r\nyer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I\r\npity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild\r\nbeast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him\r\nwhere the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats\r\nand curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could\r\nmake out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a\r\nwell-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had\r\never occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most\r\ngenial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he\r\nblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe\r\nthat he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to\r\nsay, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an\r\nhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the\r\nwindow of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the\r\nattendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent\r\non some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which\r\nhad passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden\r\nboxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the\r\nface, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the\r\npatient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to\r\nknock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the\r\nmoment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other\r\nfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his\r\nheavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but\r\nseized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and\r\nfro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others\r\nwere both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we\r\nbegan to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat\r\non him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!\r\nthey shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and\r\nall sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable\r\ndifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded\r\nroom. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set\r\nit all right; and he is going on well.",
    "\"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for\r\ndamages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their\r\nthreats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for\r\nthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it\r\nhad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and\r\nraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of\r\nhim. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary\r\nstate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of\r\ntheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their\r\nlabours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their\r\ndrift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and\r\nwith each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore\r\nthat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of\r\nmeeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took their\r\nnames and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as\r\nfollows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great\r\nWalworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal\r\nGreen.

    "\"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.\r\nSome may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him\r\nthat it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either\r\nfather or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.\r\nJonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,\r\ndeep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,\r\nand now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a\r\nfortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the\r\ndream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the\r\namount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He\r\nbegins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_\r\nhelps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave\r\nshock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard\r\nthat a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which\r\nenabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master\r\nin a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its\r\nstrength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in\r\nthe midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,\r\nfor the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan\r\ntries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming\r\nup to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.\r\nHawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his\r\nfather. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief\r\nmourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few\r\nminutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,",

    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry\r\nto-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world\r\nand all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard\r\nthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has\r\nbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother\r\nand Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.",
    "I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to\r\ngo to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him\r\nthat we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not\r\nall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed\r\nto go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. \"Come, my child,\" he said;\r\n\"come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much\r\nmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You\r\nmust not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.\r\nCome to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two\r\nsofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will\r\nbe comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we\r\nsleep.\" Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's\r\nface, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay\r\nquite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it\r\nshould be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,\r\nas in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the\r\nwindow-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk\r\nhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of\r\nthe same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and\r\nher face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her\r\nteeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they\r\nhad been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the\r\ncanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,\r\nand presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort\r\nof dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,\r\nand peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,\r\nand I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled\r\nround--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now\r\nand again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,\r\nI found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic\r\nflowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat\r\nwatching her.",
    "Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.\r\nShe took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with\r\nher now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto\r\nso marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she\r\nbecame conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was\r\ncertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the\r\nstertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she\r\nwaked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any\r\nmistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many\r\nspells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.",
    "At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen\r\ninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face\r\nI could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a\r\nsharp whisper: \"Draw up the blind; I want light!\" Then he bent down,\r\nand, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He\r\nremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As\r\nhe did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, \"Mein\r\nGott!\" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,\r\nand as I noticed some queer chill came over me.",
    "The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.",
    "For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\r\nat its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--",
    "\"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark\r\nme, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and\r\nlet him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.\"",
    "I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but\r\nwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters\r\nhe thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy\r\nwas still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van\r\nHelsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his\r\nhands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,\r\nperhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders\r\nshook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. \"Come,\" I\r\nsaid, \"my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best\r\nand easiest for her.\"",
    "When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with\r\nhis usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making\r\neverything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's\r\nhair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we\r\ncame into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered\r\nsoftly:--",
    "\"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!\" He was stooping to\r\nkiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. \"No,\" he whispered, \"not\r\nyet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.\"",
    "So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\r\nwith all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then\r\ngradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her\r\nbreast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.",
    "And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in\r\nthe night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale\r\ngums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a\r\nsort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which\r\nwere now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,\r\nsuch as I had never heard from her lips:--",
    "\"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!\" Arthur bent\r\neagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,\r\nhad been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by\r\nthe neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which\r\nI never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost\r\nacross the room.",
    "\"Not for your life!\" he said; \"not for your living soul and hers!\" And\r\nhe stood between them like a lion at bay.",
    "Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\r\nor say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised\r\nthe place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.",
    "I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as\r\nof rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed\r\ntogether. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.",
    "Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\r\nputting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown\r\none; drawing it to her, she kissed it. \"My true friend,\" she said, in a\r\nfaint voice, but with untellable pathos, \"My true friend, and his! Oh,\r\nguard him, and give me peace!\"",
    "\"I swear it!\" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\r\nhand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said\r\nto him: \"Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the\r\nforehead, and only once.\"",
    "Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.",
    "Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took\r\nArthur's arm, and drew him away.",
    "And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\r\nceased.",
    "\"It is all over,\" said Van Helsing. \"She is dead!\"",
    "I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he\r\nsat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that\r\nnearly broke me down to see.",
    "I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and\r\nhis face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.\r\nDeath had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had\r\nrecovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their\r\ndeadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working\r\nof the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as\r\nmight be.",
    "\"We thought her dying whilst she slept,\r\n        And sleeping when she died.\"",
    "I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--",
    "\"Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!\"",
    "He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--",
    "\"Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!\"",
    "When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--",
    "\"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.\"",
    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.",
    "The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\r\nher mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly\r\nformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\r\nafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.\r\nEven the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\r\nme, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\r\nfrom the death-chamber:--",
    "\"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to\r\nattend on her. It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our\r\nestablishment!\"",
    "I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from\r\nthe disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives\r\nat hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his\r\nfather's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been\r\nbidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon\r\nourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's\r\npapers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\r\nforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\r\nso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--",
    "\"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But\r\nthis is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the\r\ncoroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such\r\nas this.\"",
    "As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\r\nin Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.",
    "\"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.\r\nWestenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch\r\nhere in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself\r\nsearch for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into\r\nthe hands of strangers.\"",
    "I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found\r\nthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to\r\nhim. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions\r\nregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the\r\nletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\r\nsaying:--",
    "\"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to\r\nyou.\"",
    "\"Have you got what you looked for?\" I asked, to which he replied:--",
    "\"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I\r\nhave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\r\ndiary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\r\nnothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\r\nhis sanction, I shall use some.\"",
    "When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--",
    "\"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you\r\nand I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but\r\nfor the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!\"",
    "Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had\r\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\r\n_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\r\nand death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the\r\nwinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and\r\nturned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall\r\nwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's\r\nloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,\r\ninstead of leaving traces of \"decay's effacing fingers,\" had but\r\nrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\r\nthat I was looking at a corpse.",
    "The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and\r\nthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \"Remain till I\r\nreturn,\" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic\r\nfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\r\nplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he\r\ntook from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and\r\nplaced it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we\r\ncame away.",
    "I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\r\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--",
    "\"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\r\nknives.\"",
    "\"Must we make an autopsy?\" I asked.",
    "\"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you\r\nnow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out\r\nher heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with\r\nno tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make\r\nthe rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that\r\nyou loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\r\noperate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for\r\nArthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow,\r\nand he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined\r\nready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall\r\nunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace\r\nall, so that none know, save we alone.\"",
    "\"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body\r\nwithout need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing\r\nto gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\r\nknowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.\"",
    "For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\r\ntenderness:--",
    "\"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\r\nbecause it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden\r\nthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you\r\nshall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant\r\nthings. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet\r\ndid you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but\r\nman; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you\r\nsend for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay\r\nhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was\r\ndying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw\r\nhow she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so\r\nweak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not\r\nhear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!",
    "\"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many\r\nyears trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so\r\nstrange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend\r\nJohn. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is\r\nnot perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no\r\ntrust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,\r\noh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!\" He paused a\r\nmoment and went on solemnly: \"Friend John, there are strange and\r\nterrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to\r\na good end. Will you not have faith in me?\"",
    "I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,\r\nand watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without\r\nmoving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had\r\nher back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy\r\nlay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful\r\nto those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl\r\nputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch\r\nalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay\r\nmight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\r\nHelsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.\"",
    "\"Why not?\" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly\r\nimpressed me.",
    "\"Because,\" he said sternly, \"it is too late--or too early. See!\" Here he\r\nheld up the little golden crucifix. \"This was stolen in the night.\"",
    "\"How, stolen,\" I asked in wonder, \"since you have it now?\"",
    "\"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the\r\nwoman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely\r\ncome, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus\r\nunknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.\"",
    "He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a\r\nnew puzzle to grapple with.",
    "The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.\r\nMarquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial\r\nand very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all\r\ncares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for\r\nsome time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs\r\nin absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain\r\nentailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct\r\nissue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,\r\nreal and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had\r\ntold us so much he went on:--",
    "\"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and\r\npointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either\r\npenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial\r\nalliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into\r\ncollision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out\r\nher wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were\r\nright in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should\r\nhave proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.\r\nFrankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of\r\ndisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her\r\nwishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come\r\ninto possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her\r\nmother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\r\nwill--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been\r\ntreated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,\r\nthough so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the\r\ninheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just\r\nrights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure\r\nyou, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.\"",
    "He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which\r\nhe was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an\r\nobject-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.",
    "He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\r\nsee Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to\r\nus, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\r\ncriticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so\r\na little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in\r\nvery truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,\r\ntrue to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and\r\nthere was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at\r\nonce. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\r\nexplaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\r\nless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fianc\u00e9e_\r\nquite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and\r\nexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them\r\nthe night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings\r\nas we could avoid were saved.",
    "Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart\r\nmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\r\nmuch-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly\r\nattached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a\r\nbitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he\r\nwas sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some\r\nconstraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to\r\nbring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I\r\nfelt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and\r\nled me in, saying huskily:--",
    "\"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was\r\nno friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to\r\nthank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet....\"",
    "Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\r\nlaid his head on my breast, crying:--",
    "\"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me\r\nall at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\"",
    "I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much\r\nexpression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the\r\nshoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's\r\nheart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said\r\nsoftly to him:--",
    "\"Come and look at her.\"",
    "Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.\r\nGod! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her\r\nloveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he\r\nfell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At\r\nlast, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--",
    "\"Jack, is she really dead?\"",
    "I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt\r\nthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than\r\nI could help--that it often happened that after death faces became\r\nsoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was\r\nespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged\r\nsuffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after\r\nkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and\r\nlong, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the\r\ncoffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his\r\nand kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,\r\nfondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.",
    "I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\r\ngood-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men\r\nto proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he\r\ncame out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he\r\nreplied:--",
    "\"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\"",
    "We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make\r\nthe best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but\r\nwhen we had lit our cigars he said--",
    "\"Lord----\"; but Arthur interrupted him:--",
    "\"No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:\r\nI did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so\r\nrecent.\"",
    "The Professor answered very sweetly:--",
    "\"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you\r\n'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as\r\nArthur.\"",
    "Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.",
    "\"Call me what you will,\" he said. \"I hope I may always have the title of\r\na friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\r\nyour goodness to my poor dear.\" He paused a moment, and went on: \"I know\r\nthat she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was\r\nrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember\"--the\r\nProfessor nodded--\"you must forgive me.\"",

    "\"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such\r\nviolence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you\r\ncannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be\r\nmore times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may\r\nnot--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust\r\nshall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as\r\nthough the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from\r\nfirst to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her\r\ndear sake to whom I swore to protect.\"",
    "\"And, indeed, indeed, sir,\" said Arthur warmly, \"I shall in all ways\r\ntrust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are\r\nJack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.\"",
    "The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\r\nspeak, and finally said:--",
    "\"May I ask you something now?\"",
    "\"Certainly.\"",
    "\"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\"",
    "\"No, poor dear; I never thought of it.\"",
    "\"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I\r\nwant you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and\r\nletters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,\r\nbe sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them\r\nbefore we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch\r\nthem--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep\r\nthem, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them\r\nsafe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back\r\nto you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for\r\nLucy's sake?\"",
    "Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--",
    "\"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I\r\nam doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you\r\nwith questions till the time comes.\"",
    "The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--",
    "\"And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be\r\nall pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of\r\nall, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we\r\nreach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our\r\nduty, and all will be well!\"",
    "I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing did not go to\r\nbed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was\r\nnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with\r\nthe wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,\r\na heavy, overpowering smell into the night.",

    "_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.",
    "It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much\r\nbetween then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and\r\nno news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a\r\npartner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and\r\nJonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me\r\nabout it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what\r\nunexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up\r\nagain with an exercise anyhow....",
    "The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves\r\nand the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his\r\nLondon agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the\r\nPresident of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in\r\nhand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....",
    "We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.\r\nJonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so\r\nwe sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was\r\nsad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think\r\nof the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.\r\nJonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days\r\nbefore I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on\r\nfor some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the\r\npedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he\r\nwas my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn't\r\ncare if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful\r\ngirl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,\r\nwhen I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said\r\nunder his breath: \"My God!\" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I\r\nfear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him\r\nquickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.",
    "He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and\r\nhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and\r\nblack moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty\r\ngirl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,\r\nand so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was\r\nhard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all\r\nthe whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.\r\nJonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I\r\nfeared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked\r\nJonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that\r\nI knew as much about it as he did: \"Do you see who it is?\"",
    "\"No, dear,\" I said; \"I don't know him; who is it?\" His answer seemed to\r\nshock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was\r\nto me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--",
    "\"It is the man himself!\"",
    "The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly\r\nterrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to\r\nsupport him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of\r\nthe shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove\r\noff. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage\r\nmoved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a\r\nhansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--",
    "\"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be\r\nso! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!\" He was\r\ndistressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the\r\nsubject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him\r\naway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little\r\nfurther, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was\r\na hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.\r\nAfter a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he\r\nwent quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it\r\nwas the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty\r\nminutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--",
    "\"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.\r\nCome, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere.\" He had evidently forgotten\r\nall about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that\r\nthis episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into\r\nforgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must\r\nnot ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow\r\nlearn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I\r\nmust open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,\r\nI know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.",

    "\"You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and\r\nthat Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.\"",
    "Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor\r\nLucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have\r\nlost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our\r\ntroubles.",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has\r\ntaken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe\r\nin my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any\r\nof us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America\r\ncan go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world\r\nindeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his\r\njourney. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns\r\nto-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can\r\nonly be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says\r\nhe has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old\r\nfellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his\r\niron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting\r\nsome terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were\r\nstanding beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in\r\nthe operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I\r\ncould see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was\r\nsaying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married\r\nand that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of\r\nthe other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went\r\naway together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The\r\nmoment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of\r\nhysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted\r\nthat it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very\r\nterrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down\r\nthe blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,\r\ntill he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman\r\ndoes. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the\r\ncircumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in\r\nmanifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew\r\ngrave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.\r\nHis reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and\r\nforceful and mysterious. He said:--",
    "\"Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,\r\nthough I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But\r\nno more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come\r\njust the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your\r\ndoor and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a\r\nking, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no\r\ntime of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my\r\nheart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though\r\nI am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other\r\nsufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very\r\ngrave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her\r\ncoffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood\r\nfrom my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of\r\nthe age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his\r\nhair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet\r\nwhen he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my\r\nfather-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend\r\nJohn, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even\r\nat such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,\r\n'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of\r\nthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is\r\na strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and\r\ntroubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the\r\ntune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and\r\ntears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he\r\nmake with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that\r\nhe is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn\r\ntight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,\r\nlike the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain\r\nbecome too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the\r\nsunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with\r\nour labour, what it may be.\"",
    "I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I\r\ndid not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he\r\nanswered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different\r\ntone:--",
    "\"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with\r\nflowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she\r\nwere truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely\r\nchurchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother\r\nwho loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!\r\ntoll! toll!' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white\r\ngarments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time\r\ntheir eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all\r\nfor what? She is dead; so! Is it not?\"",
    "\"Well, for the life of me, Professor,\" I said, \"I can't see anything to\r\nlaugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle\r\nthan before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor\r\nArt and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.\"",
    "\"Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had\r\nmade her truly his bride?\"",
    "\"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.\"",
    "\"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then\r\nwhat about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,\r\nand me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though\r\nno wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,\r\nam bigamist.\"",
    "\"I don't see where the joke comes in there either!\" I said; and I did\r\nnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid\r\nhis hand on my arm, and said:--",
    "\"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others\r\nwhen it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.\r\nIf you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;\r\nif you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so\r\nnow, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for\r\nhe go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would\r\nperhaps pity me the most of all.\"",
    "I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.",
    "\"Because I know!\"",
    "And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will\r\nsit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her\r\nkin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming\r\nLondon; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,\r\nand where wild flowers grow of their own accord.",
    "So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin\r\nanother. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with\r\ndifferent people and different themes; for here at the end, where the\r\nromance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my\r\nlife-work, I say sadly and without hope,",

    "The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a\r\nseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what\r\nwas known to the writers of headlines as \"The Kensington Horror,\" or\r\n\"The Stabbing Woman,\" or \"The Woman in Black.\" During the past two or\r\nthree days several cases have occurred of young children straying from\r\nhome or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all\r\nthese cases the children were too young to give any properly\r\nintelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses\r\nis that they had been with a \"bloofer lady.\" It has always been late in\r\nthe evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the\r\nchildren have not been found until early in the following morning. It is\r\ngenerally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed\r\ngave as his reason for being away that a \"bloofer lady\" had asked him to\r\ncome for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as\r\noccasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the\r\nlittle ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A\r\ncorrespondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to\r\nbe the \"bloofer lady\" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists\r\nmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the\r\nreality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general\r\nprinciples of human nature that the \"bloofer lady\" should be the popular\r\nr\u00f4le at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent na\u00efvely says\r\nthat even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of\r\nthese grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine\r\nthemselves--to be.",
    "There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of\r\nthe children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been\r\nslightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be\r\nmade by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance\r\nindividually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has\r\na system or method of its own. The police of the division have been\r\ninstructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially\r\nwhen very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog\r\nwhich may be about.",

It has the same tiny wound in the\r\nthroat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and\r\nlooked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common\r\nstory to tell of being lured away by the \"bloofer lady.\"",

That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her\r\nsleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real\r\ntruth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my\r\nimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of\r\ncourse it is about Lucy.

It may be that it is the doubt\r\nwhich haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter\r\nwhich--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more\r\nsatisfied and better able to bear the shock.

The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost\r\nstraight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;\r\nsuch a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,\r\nbut falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set\r\nwidely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He\r\nsaid to me:--",
    "\"Mrs. Harker, is it not?\" I bowed assent.",
    "\"That was Miss Mina Murray?\" Again I assented.",
    "\"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear\r\nchild Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.\"",
    "\"Sir,\" I said, \"you could have no better claim on me than that you were\r\na friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.\" And I held out my hand. He took\r\nit and said tenderly:--",
    "\"Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be\r\ngood, but I had yet to learn----\" He finished his speech with a courtly\r\nbow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at\r\nonce began:--",
    "\"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin\r\nto inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were\r\nwith her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look\r\nsurprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in\r\nimitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain\r\nthings to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In\r\ngreat perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much\r\nkindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.\"",
    "\"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.\"",
    "\"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always\r\nso with young ladies.\"",
    "\"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you\r\nif you like.\"",
    "\"Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.\" I\r\ncould not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is\r\nsome of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our\r\nmouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful\r\nbow, and said:--",
    "\"May I read it?\"",
    "\"If you wish,\" I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for\r\nan instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.",
    "\"Oh, you so clever woman!\" he said. \"I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a\r\nman of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.\r\nAnd will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?\r\nAlas! I know not the shorthand.\" By this time my little joke was over,\r\nand I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my\r\nworkbasket and handed it to him.",
    "\"Forgive me,\" I said: \"I could not help it; but I had been thinking that\r\nit was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not\r\nhave time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must\r\nbe precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.\"",
    "He took it and his eyes glistened. \"You are so good,\" he said. \"And may\r\nI read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.\"",
    "\"By all means,\" I said, \"read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you\r\ncan ask me questions whilst we eat.\" He bowed and settled himself in a\r\nchair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,\r\nwhilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be\r\ndisturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down\r\nthe room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and\r\ntook me by both hands.",
    "\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, \"how can I say what I owe to you? This paper\r\nis as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so\r\nmuch light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that\r\nyou do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so\r\nclever woman. Madam\"--he said this very solemnly--\"if ever Abraham Van\r\nHelsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.\r\nIt will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a\r\nfriend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you\r\nand those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;\r\nyou are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and\r\nyour husband will be blessed in you.\"",
    "\"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.\"",
    "\"Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and\r\nwomen; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to\r\nhim and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you\r\nhave so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every\r\nline. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your\r\nmarriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell\r\nall their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that\r\nangels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of\r\nangels' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for\r\nyou trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your\r\nhusband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and\r\nis he strong and hearty?\" I saw here an opening to ask him about\r\nJonathan, so I said:--",
    "\"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins's\r\ndeath.\" He interrupted:--",
    "\"Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.\" I went\r\non:--",
    "\"I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he\r\nhad a sort of shock.\"",
    "\"A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of\r\na shock was it?\"",
    "\"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something\r\nwhich led to his brain fever.\" And here the whole thing seemed to\r\noverwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he\r\nexperienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that\r\nhas been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I\r\nwas hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to\r\nhim, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands\r\nand raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my\r\nhand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--",
    "\"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not\r\nhad much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by\r\nmy friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such\r\nnobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing\r\nyears--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here\r\nfull of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I\r\nam seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life\r\nhappy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for\r\nthe children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some\r\nuse to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my\r\nstudy and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him\r\nthat I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy\r\none. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.\r\nHusband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not\r\nwhere he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat\r\nand smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not\r\nspeak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I\r\nwant to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I\r\nwill ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of\r\nhusband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat\r\nnow; afterwards you shall tell me all.\"",
    "After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--",
    "\"And now tell me all about him.\" When it came to speaking to this great\r\nlearned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and\r\nJonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go\r\non. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I\r\ntrusted him, so I said:--",
    "\"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not\r\nlaugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of\r\nfever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I\r\nhave even half believed some very strange things.\" He reassured me by\r\nhis manner as well as his words when he said:--",
    "\"Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which\r\nI am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little\r\nof any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep\r\nan open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close\r\nit, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that\r\nmake one doubt if they be mad or sane.\"",
    "\"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my\r\nmind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,\r\nbut I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and\r\nJonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that\r\nhappened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and\r\njudge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell\r\nme what you think.\"",
    "\"I promise,\" he said as I gave him the papers; \"I shall in the morning,\r\nso soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.\"",
    "\"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch\r\nwith us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which\r\nwill leave you at Paddington before eight.\" He was surprised at my\r\nknowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made\r\nup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in\r\ncase he is in a hurry.",
    "So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here\r\nthinking--thinking I don't know what.",

    "_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the\r\ntime has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and\r\nwhen we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having\r\ngiven him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been\r\nabout me. She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was\r\ntrue. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the\r\nreality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in\r\nthe dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even\r\nof the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting\r\nto London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing\r\nis the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what\r\nMina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I\r\nshall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....",
    "He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he\r\nwas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my\r\nface round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--",
    "\"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.\" It was\r\nso funny to hear my wife called \"Madam Mina\" by this kindly,\r\nstrong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--",
    "\"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.\"",
    "\"And how?\"",
    "\"By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything\r\ntook a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the\r\nevidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know\r\nwhat to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been\r\nthe groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted\r\nmyself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even\r\nyourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours.\" He\r\nseemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--",
    "\"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with\r\nso much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will\r\npardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.\" I\r\nwould listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded\r\nand stood silent.",

So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an\r\negoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and\r\nselfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,\r\nand some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the\r\nknowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night.

His eyes suddenly seemed to\r\ncatch something in one of them, \"The Westminster Gazette\"--I knew it by\r\nthe colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,\r\ngroaning to himself: \"Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!\" I do not\r\nthink he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and\r\nthe train moved off.

    "_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week\r\nsince I said \"Finis,\" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather\r\ngoing on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to\r\nthink of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as\r\nhe ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had\r\njust started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble\r\nto me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I\r\ngather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with\r\nhim, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of\r\ngood spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that\r\nArthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to\r\nthem all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my\r\nwork with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might\r\nfairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming\r\ncicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the\r\nend God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,\r\ntoo, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He\r\nwent to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came\r\nback, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock,\r\nand thrust last night's \"Westminster Gazette\" into my hand.",
    "\"What do you think of that?\" he asked as he stood back and folded his\r\narms.",
    "I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he\r\ntook it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed\r\naway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a\r\npassage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An\r\nidea struck me, and I looked up. \"Well?\" he said.",
    "\"It is like poor Lucy's.\"",
    "\"And what do you make of it?\"",
    "\"Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured\r\nher has injured them.\" I did not quite understand his answer:--",
    "\"That is true indirectly, but not directly.\"",
    "\"How do you mean, Professor?\" I asked. I was a little inclined to take\r\nhis seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom\r\nfrom burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but\r\nwhen I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our\r\ndespair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.",
    "\"Tell me!\" I said. \"I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to\r\nthink, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.\"",
    "\"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to\r\nwhat poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by\r\nevents, but by me?\"",
    "\"Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.\"",
    "\"And how the blood lost or waste?\" I shook my head. He stepped over and\r\nsat down beside me, and went on:--",
    "\"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;\r\nbut you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears\r\nhear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to\r\nyou. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,\r\nand yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But\r\nthere are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's\r\neyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men\r\nhave told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to\r\nexplain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to\r\nexplain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,\r\nwhich think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend\r\nto be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not\r\nbelieve in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor\r\nin astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in\r\nhypnotism----\"",
    "\"Yes,\" I said. \"Charcot has proved that pretty well.\" He smiled as he\r\nwent on: \"Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you\r\nunderstand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great\r\nCharcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient\r\nthat he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you\r\nsimply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion\r\nbe a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you\r\naccept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my\r\nfriend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which\r\nwould have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered\r\nelectricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned\r\nas wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that\r\nMethuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and\r\nsixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor\r\nveins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we\r\ncould have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do\r\nyou know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the\r\nqualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me\r\nwhy, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived\r\nfor centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,\r\ntill, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can\r\nyou tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that\r\ncome at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their\r\nveins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang\r\non the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant\r\nnuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that\r\nit is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are\r\nfound dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?\"",
    "\"Good God, Professor!\" I said, starting up. \"Do you mean to tell me that\r\nLucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London\r\nin the nineteenth century?\" He waved his hand for silence, and went\r\non:--",
    "\"Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of\r\nmen; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and\r\nwhy the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?\r\nCan you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are\r\nsome few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and\r\nwomen who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the\r\nfact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of\r\nyears, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of\r\nthe world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die\r\nand have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the\r\ncorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men\r\ncome and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian\r\nfakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?\" Here\r\nI interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind\r\nhis list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my\r\nimagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me\r\nsome lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but\r\nhe used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of\r\nthought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I\r\nwanted to follow him, so I said:--",
    "\"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so\r\nthat I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in\r\nmy mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an\r\nidea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping\r\nfrom one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without\r\nknowing where I am going.\"",
    "\"That is good image,\" he said. \"Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is\r\nthis: I want you to believe.\"",
    "\"To believe what?\"",
    "\"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once\r\nof an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to\r\nbelieve things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.\r\nHe meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of\r\ntruth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway\r\ntruck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value\r\nhim; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in\r\nthe universe.\"",
    "\"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the\r\nreceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read\r\nyour lesson aright?\"",
    "\"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now\r\nthat you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to\r\nunderstand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's\r\nthroats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?\"",
    "\"I suppose so.\" He stood up and said solemnly:--",
    "\"Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,\r\nfar, far worse.\"",
    "\"In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?\" I cried.",
    "He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his\r\nelbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--",
    "\"They were made by Miss Lucy!\"",
    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.",
    "For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life\r\nstruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to\r\nhim:--",
    "\"Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?\" He raised his head and looked at me, and\r\nsomehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. \"Would I were!\" he\r\nsaid. \"Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my\r\nfriend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell\r\nyou so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all\r\nmy life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,\r\nnow so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a\r\nfearful death? Ah no!\"",
    "\"Forgive me,\" said I. He went on:--",
    "\"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,\r\nfor I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not\r\nexpect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract\r\ntruth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always\r\nbelieved the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a\r\nconcrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove\r\nit. Dare you come with me?\"",
    "This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron\r\nexcepted from the category, jealousy.",
    "\"And prove the very truth he most abhorred.\"",
    "He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--",
    "\"The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock\r\nto tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;\r\nat worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet\r\nvery dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,\r\nI tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child\r\nin the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers\r\nsay the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were\r\nin class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he\r\nwill not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we\r\nwish to learn. And then----\"",
    "\"And then?\" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. \"And then we\r\nspend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is\r\nthe key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to\r\nArthur.\" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful\r\nordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what\r\nheart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was\r\npassing....",
    "We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and\r\naltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its\r\nthroat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the\r\nsimilarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,\r\nand the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he\r\nattributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some\r\nanimal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think\r\nthat it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern\r\nheights of London. \"Out of so many harmless ones,\" he said, \"there may\r\nbe some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some\r\nsailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from\r\nthe Zo\u00f6logical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred\r\nthere from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago\r\na wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a\r\nweek after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the\r\nHeath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare\r\ncame along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even\r\nthis poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he\r\nmight go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted\r\nto play with the 'bloofer lady.'\"",
    "\"I hope,\" said Van Helsing, \"that when you are sending the child home\r\nyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies\r\nto stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another\r\nnight, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will\r\nnot let it away for some days?\"",
    "\"Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not\r\nhealed.\"",
    "Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and\r\nthe sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it\r\nwas, he said:--",
    "\"There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek\r\nsomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\"",
    "We dined at \"Jack Straw's Castle\" along with a little crowd of\r\nbicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we\r\nstarted from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\r\nmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\r\nradius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he\r\nwent on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to\r\nlocality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at\r\nlast we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse\r\npolice going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of\r\nthe churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for\r\nit was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found\r\nthe Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,\r\nand standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to\r\nprecede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the\r\ncourtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My\r\ncompanion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after\r\ncarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,\r\none. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he\r\nfumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,\r\nproceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed\r\nwith fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some\r\ndays afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites\r\nturning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the\r\nbeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured\r\nstone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished\r\nbrass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a\r\ncandle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been\r\nimagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was\r\nnot the only thing which could pass away.",
    "Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so\r\nthat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\r\ndropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\r\nmade assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took\r\nout a turnscrew.",
    "\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.",
    "\"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\" Straightway he began\r\ntaking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the\r\ncasing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed\r\nto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have\r\nstripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took\r\nhold of his hand to stop him. He only said: \"You shall see,\" and again\r\nfumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew\r\nthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he\r\nmade a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of\r\nthe saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We\r\ndoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to\r\nsuch things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never\r\nstopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of\r\nthe lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the\r\nedge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the\r\ncoffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to\r\nlook.",
    "I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.",
    "It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but\r\nVan Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,\r\nand so emboldened to proceed in his task. \"Are you satisfied now, friend\r\nJohn?\" he asked.",
    "I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\r\nI answered him:--",
    "\"I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only\r\nproves one thing.\"",
    "\"And what is that, friend John?\"",
    "\"That it is not there.\"",
    "\"That is good logic,\" he said, \"so far as it goes. But how do you--how\r\ncan you--account for it not being there?\"",
    "\"Perhaps a body-snatcher,\" I suggested. \"Some of the undertaker's people\r\nmay have stolen it.\" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was\r\nthe only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. \"Ah\r\nwell!\" he said, \"we must have more proof. Come with me.\"",
    "He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\r\nthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\r\nbag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and\r\nlocked it. He handed me the key, saying: \"Will you keep it? You had\r\nbetter be assured.\" I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am\r\nbound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. \"A key is nothing,\" I said;\r\n\"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock\r\nof that kind.\" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he\r\ntold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at\r\nthe other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark\r\nfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my\r\nsight.",
    "It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant\r\nclock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and\r\nunnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand\r\nand with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly\r\nobservant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had\r\na dreary, miserable time.",
    "Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\r\nstreak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard\r\nfarthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the\r\nProfessor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I\r\ntoo moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I\r\nstumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an\r\nearly cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered\r\njuniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim\r\nfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden\r\nby trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the\r\nrustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and\r\ncoming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When\r\nhe saw me he held it out to me, and said:--",
    "\"Are you satisfied now?\"",
    "\"No,\" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.",
    "\"Do you not see the child?\"",
    "\"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\" I\r\nasked.",
    "\"We shall see,\" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way\r\nout of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.",
    "When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\r\ntrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was\r\nwithout a scratch or scar of any kind.",
    "\"Was I right?\" I asked triumphantly.",
    "\"We were just in time,\" said the Professor thankfully.",
    "We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted\r\nabout it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to\r\ngive some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should\r\nhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.\r\nSo finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we\r\nheard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find\r\nit; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out\r\nwell. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy\r\ntramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until\r\nhe saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation\r\nof astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a\r\ncab near the \"Spaniards,\" and drove to town.",
    "I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'\r\nsleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall\r\ngo with him on another expedition.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable\r\nopportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,\r\nand the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily\r\naway, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw\r\nthe sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till\r\nmorning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not\r\nwant more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the\r\nreality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of\r\nplace; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were\r\nincurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.\r\nOutrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead\r\nnearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to\r\nopen the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own\r\neyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,\r\nand rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,\r\nno matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again\r\ncourteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as\r\nlast night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine\r\nstreamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.\r\nHe bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock\r\nof surprise and dismay shot through me.",
    "There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\r\nfuneral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I\r\ncould not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than\r\nbefore; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.",
    "\"Is this a juggle?\" I said to him.",
    "\"Are you convinced now?\" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke\r\nhe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the\r\ndead lips and showed the white teeth.",
    "\"See,\" he went on, \"see, they are even sharper than before. With this\r\nand this\"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below\r\nit--\"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend\r\nJohn?\" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not\r\naccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to\r\nargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--",
    "\"She may have been placed here since last night.\"",
    "\"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?\"",
    "\"I do not know. Some one has done it.\"",
    "\"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not\r\nlook so.\" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not\r\nseem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\r\ntriumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising\r\nthe eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and\r\nexamining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--",
    "\"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is\r\nsome dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire\r\nwhen she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know\r\nthat, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could\r\nhe best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she\r\nis Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when\r\nthe Un-Dead sleep at home\"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of\r\nhis arm to designate what to a vampire was \"home\"--\"their face show what\r\nthey are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to\r\nthe nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so\r\nit make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\" This turned my blood\r\ncold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's\r\ntheories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the\r\nidea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in\r\nmy face, for he said almost joyously:--",
    "\"Ah, you believe now?\"",
    "I answered: \"Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to\r\naccept. How will you do this bloody work?\"",
    "\"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\r\ndrive a stake through her body.\" It made me shudder to think of so\r\nmutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling\r\nwas not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to\r\nshudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing\r\ncalled it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,\r\nor all objective?",
    "I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\r\nif wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a\r\nsnap, and said:--",
    "\"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I\r\ndid simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is\r\nto be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are\r\nthousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is\r\nsimple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act\r\nnow would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to\r\nwant Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the\r\nwounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at\r\nthe hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full\r\nto-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more\r\nbeautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know\r\nof the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,\r\nand yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect\r\nArthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I\r\ntook him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me\r\nbecause in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say\r\ngood-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea\r\nthis woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have\r\nkilled her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that\r\nhave killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet\r\nhe never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will\r\nsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint\r\nhis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he\r\nwill think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,\r\nan Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since\r\nI know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he\r\nmust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,\r\nmust have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to\r\nhim; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is\r\nmade up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see\r\nthat all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this\r\nchurchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the\r\nBerkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,\r\nand also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we\r\nshall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and\r\nthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.\"",
    "So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the\r\nchurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.",

    "\"Friend John,--",
    "\"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in\r\nthat churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not\r\nleave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.\r\nTherefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a\r\ncrucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,\r\nand will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they\r\nmay not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is\r\ndesperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may\r\nbe. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,\r\nand if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss\r\nLucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that\r\nshe is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.\r\nHe is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all\r\nalong he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and\r\nwe lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the\r\nstrength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength\r\nto Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and\r\nI know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall\r\nfind me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that\r\nhe will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his\r\nhunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the\r\nUn-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.",
    "\"Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,\r\nthe diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this\r\ngreat Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake\r\nthrough it, so that the world may rest from him.",

    "_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for\r\none. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous\r\nideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on\r\ncommon sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his\r\nmind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_\r\nrational explanation of all these mysterious things.

    "_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,\r\nArthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he\r\nwanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all\r\nour wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would\r\nall come with him too, \"for,\" he said, \"there is a grave duty to be done\r\nthere. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?\" This query was\r\ndirectly addressed to Lord Godalming.",
    "\"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble\r\naround my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been\r\ncurious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the\r\nmore we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself\r\nthat I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.\"",
    "\"Me too,\" said Quincey Morris laconically.",
    "\"Oh,\" said the Professor, \"then you are nearer the beginning, both of\r\nyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can\r\neven get so far as to begin.\"",
    "It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of\r\nmind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said\r\nwith intense gravity:--",
    "\"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I\r\nknow, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will\r\nknow, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me\r\nin the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a\r\ntime--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may\r\nbe--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.\"",
    "\"That's frank anyhow,\" broke in Quincey. \"I'll answer for the Professor.\r\nI don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good\r\nenough for me.\"",
    "\"I thank you, sir,\" said Van Helsing proudly. \"I have done myself the\r\nhonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear\r\nto me.\" He held out a hand, which Quincey took.",
    "Then Arthur spoke out:--",
    "\"Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they\r\nsay in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman\r\nor my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.\r\nIf you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of\r\nthese two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I\r\ncannot understand what you are driving at.\"",
    "\"I accept your limitation,\" said Van Helsing, \"and all I ask of you is\r\nthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first\r\nconsider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your\r\nreservations.\"",
    "\"Agreed!\" said Arthur; \"that is only fair. And now that the\r\n_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?\"",
    "\"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at\r\nKingstead.\"",

    "\"Where poor Lucy is buried?\" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: \"And\r\nwhen there?\"",
    "\"To enter the tomb!\" Arthur stood up.",
    "\"Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,\r\nI see that you are in earnest.\" He sat down again, but I could see that\r\nhe sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was\r\nsilence until he asked again:--",
    "\"And when in the tomb?\"",
    "\"To open the coffin.\"",
    "\"This is too much!\" he said, angrily rising again. \"I am willing to be\r\npatient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration\r\nof the grave--of one who----\" He fairly choked with indignation. The\r\nProfessor looked pityingly at him.",
    "\"If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,\" he said, \"God knows I\r\nwould. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and\r\nfor ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!\"",
    "Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--",
    "\"Take care, sir, take care!\"",
    "\"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?\" said Van Helsing.\r\n\"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go\r\non?\"",
    "\"That's fair enough,\" broke in Morris.",
    "After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--",
    "\"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to\r\nher. But if she be not dead----\"",
    "Arthur jumped to his feet.",
    "\"Good God!\" he cried. \"What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has\r\nshe been buried alive?\" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could\r\nsoften.",
    "\"I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no\r\nfurther than to say that she might be Un-Dead.\"",
    "\"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what\r\nis it?\"",
    "\"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they\r\nmay solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But\r\nI have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\"",
    "\"Heavens and earth, no!\" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. \"Not for\r\nthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.\r\nVan Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should\r\ntorture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to\r\ncast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or\r\nam I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a\r\ndesecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a\r\nduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do\r\nit!\"",
    "Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and\r\nsaid, gravely and sternly:--",
    "\"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty\r\nto you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you\r\nnow is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when\r\nlater I make the same request you do not be more eager for its\r\nfulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it\r\nmay seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall\r\nhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where\r\nyou will.\" His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of\r\npity:--",
    "\"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of\r\nacts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring\r\nmy heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if\r\nthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from\r\nyou will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can\r\nto save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so\r\nmuch of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land\r\nto do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and\r\nthen to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I\r\nam ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you\r\ngave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her\r\nlover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights\r\nand days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good\r\neven now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\" He\r\nsaid this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected\r\nby it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--",
    "\"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I\r\nshall go with you and wait.\"",
    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_",
    "It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the\r\nchurchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams\r\nof moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across\r\nthe sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly\r\nin front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked\r\nwell at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so\r\nsorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it\r\nthat the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant\r\nto his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural\r\nhesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by\r\nentering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.\r\nHe then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped\r\nforward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--",
    "\"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\r\ncoffin?\"",
    "\"It was.\" The Professor turned to the rest saying:--",
    "\"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.\" He\r\ntook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur\r\nlooked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped\r\nforward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,\r\nat any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,\r\nthe blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away\r\nagain, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.\r\nVan Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and\r\nrecoiled.",
    "The coffin was empty!",
    "For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by\r\nQuincey Morris:--",
    "\"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask\r\nsuch a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a\r\ndoubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.\r\nIs this your doing?\"",
    "\"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor\r\ntouched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and\r\nI came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which\r\nwas then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and\r\nsaw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in\r\nday-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?\"",
    "\"Yes.\"",
    "\"That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,\r\nand we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came\r\nhere before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here\r\nall the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable\r\nthat it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,\r\nwhich the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last\r\nnight there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my\r\ngarlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But\r\nbear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me\r\noutside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.\r\nSo\"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--\"now to the outside.\"\r\nHe opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the\r\ndoor behind him.",
    "Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of\r\nthat vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing\r\ngleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and\r\npassing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was\r\nto breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how\r\nhumanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to\r\nhear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each\r\nin his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I\r\ncould see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the\r\nmystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to\r\nthrow aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey\r\nMorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and\r\naccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to\r\nstake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of\r\ntobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a\r\ndefinite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like\r\nthin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white\r\nnapkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like\r\ndough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the\r\nmass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin\r\nstrips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its\r\nsetting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,\r\nasked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near\r\nalso, as they too were curious. He answered:--",
    "\"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.\"",
    "\"And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?\" asked Quincey.\r\n\"Great Scott! Is this a game?\"",
    "\"It is.\"",
    "\"What is that which you are using?\" This time the question was by\r\nArthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--",
    "\"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.\" It was an\r\nanswer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually\r\nthat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a\r\npurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was\r\nimpossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places\r\nassigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any\r\none approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself\r\nbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,\r\nwho had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink\r\nwithin me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or\r\nyew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree\r\nor grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so\r\nmysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a\r\nwoeful presage through the night.",
    "There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the\r\nProfessor a keen \"S-s-s-s!\" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews\r\nwe saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something\r\ndark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of\r\nmoonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling\r\nprominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.\r\nWe could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a\r\nfair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a\r\nchild gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We\r\nwere starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as\r\nhe stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the\r\nwhite figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see\r\nclearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,\r\nand I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of\r\nLucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was\r\nturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous\r\nwantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we\r\nall advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the\r\ntomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the\r\nconcentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips\r\nwere crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her\r\nchin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.",
    "We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even\r\nVan Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had\r\nnot seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.",
    "When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her\r\nshape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives\r\nwhen taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form\r\nand colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of\r\nthe pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love\r\npassed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have\r\ndone it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy\r\nlight, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,\r\nhow it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to\r\nthe ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had\r\nclutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls\r\nover a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There\r\nwas a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when\r\nshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell\r\nback and hid his face in his hands.",
    "She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are\r\nhungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\"",
    "There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the\r\ntingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us\r\nwho heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under\r\na spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She\r\nwas leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between\r\nthem his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a\r\nsuddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter\r\nthe tomb.",
    "When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if\r\narrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was\r\nshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no\r\nquiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled\r\nmalice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by\r\nmortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw\r\nout sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of\r\nthe flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,\r\nblood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\r\nthe Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could\r\nkill--we saw it at that moment.",
    "And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\r\nbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\r\nentry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--",
    "\"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?\"",
    "Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he\r\nanswered:--",
    "\"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like\r\nthis ever any more;\" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I\r\nsimultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the\r\nclick of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close\r\nto the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred\r\nemblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified\r\namazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal\r\nbody as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice\r\nwhere scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of\r\nrelief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty\r\nto the edges of the door.",
    "When this was done, he lifted the child and said:",
    "\"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a\r\nfuneral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The\r\nfriends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock\r\nthe gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of\r\nto-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow\r\nnight he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find\r\nhim, as on the other night; and then to home.\" Coming close to Arthur,\r\nhe said:--",
    "\"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look\r\nback, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter\r\nwaters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have\r\npassed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn\r\novermuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\"",
    "Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\r\non the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all\r\nslept with more or less reality of sleep.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,\r\nQuincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to\r\nnotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of\r\ncourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of\r\nus wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and\r\nstrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the\r\ngravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief\r\nthat every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to\r\nourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a\r\nlong leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of\r\nfair weight.",
    "When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\r\nthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\r\nProfessor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it\r\nbehind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also\r\ntwo wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own\r\nends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work\r\nby. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur\r\ntrembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its\r\ndeath-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but\r\nloathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her\r\nsoul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently\r\nhe said to Van Helsing:--",
    "\"Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?\"",
    "\"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her\r\nas she was, and is.\"",
    "She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,\r\nthe bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to\r\nsee--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a\r\ndevilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual\r\nmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\r\nplacing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some\r\nplumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in\r\na corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue\r\nflame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a\r\nround wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about\r\nthree feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and\r\nwas sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such\r\nas in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To\r\nme, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and\r\nbracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was\r\nto cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their\r\ncourage, and remained silent and quiet.",
    "When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--",
    "\"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and\r\nexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers\r\nof the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the\r\ncurse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age\r\nadding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that\r\ndie from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey\r\non their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the\r\nripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met\r\nthat kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night\r\nwhen you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,\r\nhave become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would\r\nall time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.\r\nThe career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those\r\nchildren whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if\r\nshe live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her\r\npower over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that\r\nso wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny\r\nwounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays\r\nunknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when\r\nthis now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor\r\nlady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by\r\nnight and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she\r\nshall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will\r\nbe a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.\r\nTo this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better\r\nright? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the\r\nnight when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it\r\nwas the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would\r\nherself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be\r\nsuch a one amongst us?\"",
    "We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite\r\nkindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore\r\nLucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and\r\nsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as\r\nsnow:--",
    "\"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me\r\nwhat I am to do, and I shall not falter!\" Van Helsing laid a hand on his\r\nshoulder, and said:--",
    "\"Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be\r\ndriven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in\r\nthat--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more\r\nthan your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though\r\nyou tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only\r\nthink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\r\nyou all the time.\"",
    "\"Go on,\" said Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me what I am to do.\"",
    "\"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the\r\nheart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for\r\nthe dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall\r\nfollow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that\r\nwe love and that the Un-Dead pass away.\"",
    "Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on\r\naction his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened\r\nhis missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we\r\ncould. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could\r\nsee its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.",
    "The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\r\ncame from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted\r\nin wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the\r\nlips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur\r\nnever faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm\r\nrose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst\r\nthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His\r\nface was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it\r\ngave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little\r\nvault.",
    "And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\r\nteeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The\r\nterrible task was over.",
    "The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had\r\nwe not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,\r\nand his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain\r\non him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human\r\nconsiderations he could never have gone through with it. For a few\r\nminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the\r\ncoffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one\r\nto the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had\r\nbeen seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,\r\nstrange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of\r\nhorror that lay upon it.",
    "There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded\r\nand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a\r\nprivilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in\r\nher life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that\r\nthere were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and\r\npain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth\r\nto what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like\r\nsunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and\r\nsymbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.",
    "Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to\r\nhim:--",
    "\"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\"",
    "The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand\r\nin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--",
    "\"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,\r\nand me peace.\" He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying\r\nhis head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\r\nunmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--",
    "\"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as\r\nshe would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning\r\ndevil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is\r\nthe devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!\"",
    "Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\r\ntomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point\r\nof it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with\r\ngarlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,\r\nand gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked\r\nthe door he gave the key to Arthur.",
    "Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\r\nseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was\r\ngladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\r\non one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.",
    "Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--",
    "\"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing\r\nto ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author\r\nof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can\r\nfollow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in\r\nit, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all\r\nof us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do\r\nwe not promise to go on to the bitter end?\"",
    "Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the\r\nProfessor as we moved off:--",
    "\"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of\r\nthe clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you\r\nknow not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans\r\nunfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult\r\nabout, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall\r\nreturn to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I\r\nshall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.\r\nThen our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a\r\nterrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we\r\nmust not draw back.\"",
    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_",
    "When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram\r\nwaiting for him:--",
    "\"Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA\r\n     HARKER.\"",
    "The Professor was delighted. \"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,\" he said,\r\n\"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your\r\nhouse, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en\r\nroute_, so that she may be prepared.\"",
    "When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of\r\na diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten\r\ncopy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. \"Take these,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of\r\nall the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep\r\nthem safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your\r\nfaith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What\r\nis here told,\" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of\r\npapers as he spoke, \"may be the beginning of the end to you and me and\r\nmany another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the\r\nearth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in\r\nany way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have\r\nkept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we\r\nshall go through all these together when we meet.\" He then made ready\r\nfor his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I\r\ntook my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before\r\nthe train came in.",
    "The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival\r\nplatforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my\r\nguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,\r\nafter a quick glance, said: \"Dr. Seward, is it not?\"",
    "\"And you are Mrs. Harker!\" I answered at once; whereupon she held out\r\nher hand.",
    "\"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----\" She stopped\r\nsuddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.",
    "The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it\r\nwas a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a\r\ntypewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had\r\nsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom\r\nprepared at once for Mrs. Harker.",
    "In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a\r\nlunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder\r\nwhen we entered.",
    "She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as\r\nshe had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph\r\ndiary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at\r\nthe papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before\r\nme. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an\r\nopportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or\r\nwhat a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here\r\nshe is!",

    "_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's\r\nstudy. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking\r\nwith some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at\r\nthe door, and on his calling out, \"Come in,\" I entered.",
    "To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,\r\nand on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the\r\ndescription to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much\r\ninterested.",
    "\"I hope I did not keep you waiting,\" I said; \"but I stayed at the door\r\nas I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.\"",
    "\"Oh,\" he replied with a smile, \"I was only entering my diary.\"",
    "\"Your diary?\" I asked him in surprise.",
    "\"Yes,\" he answered. \"I keep it in this.\" As he spoke he laid his hand on\r\nthe phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--",
    "\"Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?\"",
    "\"Certainly,\" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train\r\nfor speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.",
    "\"The fact is,\" he began awkwardly, \"I only keep my diary in it; and as\r\nit is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that\r\nis, I mean----\" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his\r\nembarrassment:--",
    "\"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;\r\nfor all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very\r\ndear to me.\"",
    "To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--",
    "\"Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!\"",
    "\"Why not?\" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.\r\nAgain he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.\r\nAt length he stammered out:--",
    "\"You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the\r\ndiary.\" Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said\r\nwith unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the na\u00efvet\u00e9\r\nof a child: \"That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!\" I could\r\nnot but smile, at which he grimaced. \"I gave myself away that time!\" he\r\nsaid. \"But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months\r\npast, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular\r\npart of it in case I wanted to look it up?\" By this time my mind was\r\nmade up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have\r\nsomething to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and\r\nI said boldly:--",
    "\"Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my\r\ntypewriter.\" He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--",
    "\"No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible\r\nstory!\"",
    "Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,\r\nand as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or\r\nsome opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on\r\nthe table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,\r\nfollowed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.",
    "\"You do not know me,\" I said. \"When you have read those papers--my own\r\ndiary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me\r\nbetter. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in\r\nthis cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not\r\nexpect you to trust me so far.\"",
    "He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about\r\nhim. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in\r\norder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.\r\nBut I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long\r\nago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make\r\nthe only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the\r\nfirst half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify\r\nyou; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the\r\nmeantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better\r\nable to understand certain things.\" He carried the phonograph himself up\r\nto my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something\r\npleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love\r\nepisode of which I know one side already....",

    "_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan\r\nHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without\r\nthinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce\r\ndinner, so I said: \"She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,\" and\r\nI went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when\r\nshe came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were\r\nflushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had\r\ncause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and\r\nnow the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went\r\nstraight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--",
    "\"I greatly fear I have distressed you.\"",
    "\"Oh, no, not distressed me,\" she replied, \"but I have been more touched\r\nthan I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is\r\ncruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.\r\nIt was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them\r\nspoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the\r\nwords on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as\r\nI did.\"",
    "\"No one need ever know, shall ever know,\" I said in a low voice. She\r\nlaid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--",
    "\"Ah, but they must!\"",
    "\"Must! But why?\" I asked.",
    "\"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy's\r\ndeath and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have\r\nbefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all\r\nthe knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the\r\ncylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;\r\nbut I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark\r\nmystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain\r\npoint; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,\r\nhow poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought\r\nout. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van\r\nHelsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he\r\nwill be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;\r\nworking together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than\r\nif some of us were in the dark.\" She looked at me so appealingly, and at\r\nthe same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,\r\nthat I gave in at once to her wishes. \"You shall,\" I said, \"do as you\r\nlike in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible\r\nthings yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to\r\npoor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the\r\ndark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,\r\nthere is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;\r\nwe have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn\r\nthe rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything\r\nwhich you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were\r\npresent.\"",

    "_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He\r\nbrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He\r\nplaced me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I\r\ncould touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case\r\nI should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his\r\nback to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I\r\nput the forked metal to my ears and listened.",
    "When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, was\r\ndone, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a\r\nfainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a\r\nhorrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a\r\ncupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored\r\nme. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all\r\nthe multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy\r\nwas at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without\r\nmaking a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I\r\nhad not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have\r\nbelieved. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my\r\ndifficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my\r\ntypewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--",
    "\"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing\r\nwhen he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when\r\nhe arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,\r\nand I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item\r\nput in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that\r\nLord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him\r\nwhen they come.\" He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I\r\nbegan to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used\r\nmanifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with\r\nall the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about\r\nhis work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he\r\ncame back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely\r\nwhilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of\r\ngood men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I\r\nremembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's\r\nperturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at\r\nExeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the\r\nfiles of \"The Westminster Gazette\" and \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" and took\r\nthem to my room. I remember how much \"The Dailygraph\" and \"The Whitby\r\nGazette,\" of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the\r\nterrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look\r\nthrough the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new\r\nlight. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.",

If this journal be true--and\r\njudging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man\r\nof great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a\r\nremarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was\r\nprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,\r\nbusiness-like gentleman who came here to-day.",

    "_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,\r\nand as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They\r\nare hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in\r\nchronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got\r\nthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the\r\ncarriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's\r\ntypescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it\r\nis....",
    "Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be\r\n     the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues\r\n     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters\r\n     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,\r\n     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!\r\n     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again\r\n     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be\r\n     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the\r\n     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of\r\n     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,\r\n     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing\r\n     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have\r\n     found the dates otherwise....",
    "I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands\r\n     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any\r\n     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of\r\n     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own\r\n     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my\r\n     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite\r\n     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I\r\n     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of\r\n     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a\r\n     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All\r\n     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the\r\n     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that\r\n     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?\r\n     Stay; he is himself zo\u00f6phagous, and in his wild ravings outside the\r\n     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of \"master.\" This\r\n     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came\r\n     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it\r\n     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,\r\n     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so\r\n     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to\r\n     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.",

    "_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington's\r\ncourteous message that he would give me any information in his power I\r\nthought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such\r\ninquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo\r\nof the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal\r\nwith it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and\r\nbrought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must\r\nstay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:\r\ngive a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all\r\nknew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had\r\nready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.\r\nIt gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had\r\nseen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.\r\nEverything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and\r\nwith precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which\r\nmight be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried\r\nout. To use an Americanism, he had \"taken no chances,\" and the absolute\r\naccuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the\r\nlogical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:\r\n\"Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.\"\r\nAlso the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of\r\nthese I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could\r\ngive me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs\r\nofficers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the\r\nstrange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local\r\ntradition; but no one could add to the simple description \"Fifty cases\r\nof common earth.\" I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in\r\ncommunication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their\r\ntally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that\r\nthe boxes were \"main and mortal heavy,\" and that shifting them was dry\r\nwork. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any\r\ngentleman \"such-like as yourself, squire,\" to show some sort of\r\nappreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider\r\nthat the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had\r\nelapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care\r\nbefore leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of\r\nreproach.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to\r\nhis old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when I\r\narrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of\r\nthe boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper\r\nofficials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original\r\ninvoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here\r\nlimited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was\r\ncompelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.",
    "From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met\r\nwith the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their\r\nday-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross\r\noffice for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming\r\nwere waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending\r\nalso by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the\r\ndelivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing\r\nexactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the\r\nwritten words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected\r\nalmost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent\r\nthirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,\r\nthrough the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a\r\nlater period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--",
    "\"That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it\r\nain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in\r\nthe place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones;\r\nan' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole\r\nJerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me\r\nand my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', I\r\nwouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.\"",

    "Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at\r\nWhitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old\r\nchapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have\r\nsince been removed--as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.",

I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a\r\nface as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,\r\nhowever, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never\r\nso full of volcanic energy, as at present.

Of\r\ncourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van\r\nHelsing, too, has been quite \"blowing my trumpet,\" as Mr. Morris\r\nexpressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all\r\nabout the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to\r\nsay or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they\r\nhad to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post\r\nthem in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that\r\nthey had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear\r\nto betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I\r\ncould, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband\r\nand I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.\r\nI gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got\r\nhis and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--",
    "\"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?\"",
    "I nodded, and he went on:--",
    "\"I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and\r\nkind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all\r\nI can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have\r\nhad one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble\r\nto the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--\"\r\nHere he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear\r\nthe tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid\r\na hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the\r\nroom. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man\r\nfree to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or\r\nemotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when\r\nLord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and\r\ngave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I\r\nhope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it\r\nafterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I\r\n_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I\r\ncould see that his heart was breaking:--",
    "\"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to\r\nher. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let\r\nme be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have\r\nhad, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can\r\nhelp in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for\r\nLucy's sake?\"",
    "In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed\r\nto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a\r\nvent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat\r\nhis palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat\r\ndown again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite\r\npity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his\r\nhead on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with\r\nemotion.",
    "We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above\r\nsmaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big\r\nsorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby\r\nthat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he\r\nwere my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.",
    "After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\r\napology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for\r\ndays and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been\r\nunable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\r\nsorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with\r\nwhom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was\r\nsurrounded, he could speak freely. \"I know now how I suffered,\" he said,\r\nas he dried his eyes, \"but I do not know even yet--and none other can\r\never know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall\r\nknow better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful\r\nnow, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be\r\nlike a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?\"",
    "\"For dear Lucy's sake,\" I said as we clasped hands. \"Ay, and for your\r\nown sake,\" he added, \"for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth\r\nthe winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring\r\nto you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call\r\nin vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the\r\nsunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you\r\nwill let me know.\" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that\r\nI felt it would comfort him, so I said:--",
    "\"I promise.\"",
    "As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.\r\nHe turned as he heard my footsteps. \"How is Art?\" he said. Then noticing\r\nmy red eyes, he went on: \"Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor\r\nold fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in\r\ntrouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.\"",
    "He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the\r\nmanuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise\r\nhow much I knew; so I said to him:--",
    "\"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me\r\nbe your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You\r\nwill know, later on, why I speak.\" He saw that I was in earnest, and\r\nstooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed\r\nbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I\r\nbent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a\r\nmomentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--",
    "\"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long\r\nas ever you live!\" Then he went into the study to his friend.",
    "\"Little girl!\"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he\r\nproved himself a friend!",
    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY",
    "_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming\r\nand Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript\r\nof the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife\r\nhad made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the\r\ncarriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave\r\nus a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I\r\nhave lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had\r\nfinished, Mrs. Harker said:--",
    "\"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.\r\nRenfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary\r\ninterests me so much!\" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I\r\ncould not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so\r\nI took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a\r\nlady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \"Why?\"",
    "\"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\" I\r\nanswered. \"Oh, very well,\" he said; \"let her come in, by all means; but\r\njust wait a minute till I tidy up the place.\" His method of tidying was\r\npeculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes\r\nbefore I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was\r\njealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting\r\ntask, he said cheerfully: \"Let the lady come in,\" and sat down on the\r\nedge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that\r\nhe could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might\r\nhave some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just\r\nbefore he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I\r\ncould seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She\r\ncame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command\r\nthe respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad\r\npeople most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and\r\nheld out her hand.",
    "\"Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,\" said she. \"You see, I know you, for Dr.\r\nSeward has told me of you.\" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all\r\nover intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one\r\nof wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,\r\nyou know, for she's dead.\" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--",
    "\"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever\r\nsaw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.\"",
    "\"Then what are you doing here?\"",
    "\"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.\"",
    "\"Then don't stay.\"",
    "\"But why not?\" I thought that this style of conversation might not be\r\npleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--",
    "\"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?\" His reply was simply\r\ncontemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.\r\nHarker to me, instantly turning them back again:--",
    "\"What an asinine question!\"",
    "\"I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\" said Mrs. Harker, at once\r\nchampioning me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as\r\nhe had shown contempt to me:--",
    "\"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so\r\nloved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of\r\ninterest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his\r\nhousehold and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of\r\nthem hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and\r\neffects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I\r\ncannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates\r\nlean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.\" I\r\npositively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet\r\nlunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met\r\nwith--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished\r\ngentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched\r\nsome chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any\r\nway due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or\r\npower.",
    "We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly\r\nquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\r\nbegan, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for\r\nhe addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the\r\ncompletest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned\r\ncertain things.",
    "\"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,\r\nit was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being\r\nput under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and\r\nperpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no\r\nmatter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong\r\nlife. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to\r\ntake human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I\r\ntried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by\r\nthe assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his\r\nblood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is\r\nthe life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has\r\nvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,\r\ndoctor?\" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to\r\neither think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up\r\nhis spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I\r\nsaw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.\r\nHarker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying\r\npleasantly to Mr. Renfield: \"Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,\r\nunder auspices pleasanter to yourself,\" to which, to my astonishment, he\r\nreplied:--",
    "\"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.\r\nMay He bless and keep you!\"",
    "When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind\r\nme. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took\r\nill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for\r\nmany a long day.",
    "Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a\r\nboy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--",
    "\"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come\r\nhere to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have\r\nmuch to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And\r\nArthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!\"",
    "As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own\r\ndiary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at\r\nwhich the Professor interrupted me:--",
    "\"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man\r\nshould have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God\r\nfashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good\r\ncombination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help\r\nto us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible\r\naffair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are\r\ndetermined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is\r\nno part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her\r\nin so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in\r\nwaking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,\r\nshe is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to\r\nthink of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she\r\nmust consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and\r\nwe go alone.\" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we\r\nhad found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was\r\nthe very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed\r\nto come on him. \"Oh that we had known it before!\" he said, \"for then we\r\nmight have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk\r\nthat is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think\r\nof that, but go on our way to the end.\" Then he fell into a silence that\r\nlasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for\r\ndinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--",
    "\"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have\r\nput up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.\"",
    "\"Not up to this moment, Professor,\" she said impulsively, \"but up to\r\nthis morning.\"",
    "\"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the\r\nlittle things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who\r\nhas told is the worse for it.\"",
    "Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It\r\nis my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at\r\npresent everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except\r\nwhat is personal. Must it go in?\" The Professor read it over gravely,\r\nand handed it back, saying:--",
    "\"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can\r\nbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more\r\nhonour you--as well as more esteem and love.\" She took it back with\r\nanother blush and a bright smile.",
    "And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete\r\nand in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,\r\nand before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us\r\nhave already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all\r\nbe informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this\r\nterrible and mysterious enemy.",
    "_Mina Harker's Journal._",
    "_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after\r\ndinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of\r\nboard or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to\r\nwhich Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit\r\nnext to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat\r\nnext to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.\r\nMorris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the\r\ncentre. The Professor said:--",
    "\"I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts\r\nthat are in these papers.\" We all expressed assent, and he went on:--",
    "\"Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of\r\nenemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you\r\nsomething of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.\r\nSo we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure\r\naccording.",
    "\"There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they\r\nexist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the\r\nteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane\r\npeoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that\r\nthrough long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not\r\nhave believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!\r\nI prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,\r\nhad I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of\r\nus who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other\r\npoor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die\r\nlike the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being\r\nstronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is\r\namongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of\r\ncunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have\r\nstill the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the\r\ndivination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are\r\nfor him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in\r\ncallous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear\r\nat will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he\r\ncan, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the\r\nthunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and\r\nthe bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become\r\nsmall; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to\r\nbegin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having\r\nfound it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible\r\ntask that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave\r\nshudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then\r\nwhere end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not\r\nmere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward\r\nbecome foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,\r\npreying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for\r\never are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?\r\nWe go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's\r\nsunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face\r\nto face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;\r\nbut then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his\r\nsong of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are\r\nyoung. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What\r\nsay you?\"",
    "Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so\r\nmuch, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I\r\nsaw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so\r\nstrong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for\r\nitself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.",
    "When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I\r\nin his; there was no need for speaking between us.",
    "\"I answer for Mina and myself,\" he said.",
    "\"Count me in, Professor,\" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.",
    "\"I am with you,\" said Lord Godalming, \"for Lucy's sake, if for no other\r\nreason.\"",
    "Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his\r\ngolden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took\r\nhis right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with\r\nhis left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our\r\nsolemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even\r\noccur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing\r\nwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work\r\nhad begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\r\nas any other transaction of life:--",
    "\"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not\r\nwithout strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power\r\ndenied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to\r\nact and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.\r\nIn fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are\r\nfree to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to\r\nachieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.",
    "\"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\r\nrestrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the\r\nlimitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.",
    "\"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not\r\nat the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay\r\nof more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the\r\nfirst place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and\r\nsecondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and\r\nsuperstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for\r\nothers--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would\r\nhave received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,\r\nsceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief\r\nthat we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the\r\nvampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the\r\nmoment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere\r\nthat men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany\r\nall over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so\r\nfar from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at\r\nthis day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the\r\ndevil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we\r\nhave all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the\r\nbeliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy\r\nexperience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the\r\ntime; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the\r\nliving. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow\r\nyounger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though\r\nthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he\r\ncannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend\r\nJonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!\r\nHe throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again\r\nJonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again\r\nJonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him\r\nfrom the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather\r\nfrom the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as\r\nbat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John\r\nsaw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at\r\nthe window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble\r\nship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance\r\nhe can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He\r\ncome on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those\r\nsisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw\r\nMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the\r\ntomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or\r\ninto anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with\r\nfire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,\r\nin a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me\r\nthrough. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even\r\nmore prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.\r\nHe cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey\r\nsome of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the\r\nfirst, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;\r\nthough afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does\r\nthat of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times\r\ncan he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is\r\nbound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.\r\nThese things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by\r\ninference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he\r\nhave his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place\r\nunhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at\r\nWhitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is\r\nsaid, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood\r\nof the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no\r\npower, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this\r\nsymbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to\r\nthem he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and\r\nsilent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,\r\nlest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his\r\ncoffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the\r\ncoffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through\r\nhim, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.\r\nWe have seen it with our eyes.",
    "\"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\r\nhim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is\r\nclever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\r\nmake his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he\r\nhas been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his\r\nname against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of\r\nTurkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,\r\nand for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most\r\ncunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the\r\nforest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his\r\ngrave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says\r\nArminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who\r\nwere held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They\r\nlearned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake\r\nHermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the\r\nrecords are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and\r\n'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is\r\nspoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been\r\nfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their\r\ngraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it\r\nis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in\r\nall good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\"",
    "Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,\r\nand he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little\r\npause, and then the Professor went on:--",
    "\"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must\r\nproceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan\r\nthat from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which\r\nwere delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes\r\nhave been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to\r\nascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall\r\nwhere we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the\r\nlatter, we must trace----\"",
    "Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came\r\nthe sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a\r\nbullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the\r\nfar wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked\r\nout. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the\r\nwindow and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice\r\nwithout:--",
    "\"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about\r\nit.\" A minute later he came in and said:--",
    "\"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.\r\nHarker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But\r\nthe fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat\r\nand sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned\r\nbrutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to\r\nhave a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have\r\nseen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\"",
    "\"Did you hit it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing.",
    "\"I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.\" Without\r\nsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his\r\nstatement:--",
    "\"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must\r\neither capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to\r\nspeak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.\r\nThus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of\r\nnoon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.",
    "\"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.\r\nYou are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you\r\nno more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men\r\nand are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we\r\nshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we\r\nare.\"",
    "All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me\r\ngood that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their\r\nsafety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their\r\nminds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,\r\nI could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.",
    "Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--",
    "\"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right\r\nnow. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save\r\nanother victim.\"",
    "I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so\r\nclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I\r\nappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave\r\nme out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,\r\nwith means to get into the house.",
    "Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can\r\nsleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend\r\nto sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an\r\nurgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see\r\nhim at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.\r\nI told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the\r\nmorning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--",
    "\"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't\r\nknow but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his\r\nviolent fits.\" I knew the man would not have said this without some\r\ncause, so I said: \"All right; I'll go now\"; and I asked the others to\r\nwait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my \"patient.\"",
    "\"Take me with you, friend John,\" said the Professor. \"His case in your\r\ndiary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_\r\ncase. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is\r\ndisturbed.\"",
    "\"May I come also?\" asked Lord Godalming.",
    "\"Me too?\" said Quincey Morris. \"May I come?\" said Harker. I nodded, and\r\nwe all went down the passage together.",
    "We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\r\nrational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an\r\nunusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever\r\nmet with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would\r\nprevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but\r\nnone of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would\r\nat once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up\r\nwith arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own\r\nexisting sanity. \"I appeal to your friends,\" he said, \"they will,\r\nperhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have\r\nnot introduced me.\" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of\r\nintroducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,\r\nbesides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of\r\nthe habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: \"Lord\r\nGodalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.\r\nRenfield.\" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--",
    "\"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the\r\nWindham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no\r\nmore. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his\r\nyouth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much\r\npatronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great\r\nstate. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have\r\nfar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold\r\nalliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a\r\nvast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true\r\nplace as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at\r\nmeeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\r\nconventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics\r\nby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,\r\nconventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to\r\none of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by\r\nthe possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective\r\nplaces in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at\r\nleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.\r\nAnd I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as\r\nwell as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to\r\nbe considered as under exceptional circumstances.\" He made this last\r\nappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own\r\ncharm.",
    "I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the\r\nconviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,\r\nthat his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to\r\ntell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the\r\nnecessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it\r\nbetter to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old\r\nI knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.\r\nSo I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared\r\nto be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him\r\nin the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of\r\nmeeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said\r\nquickly:--",
    "\"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to\r\ngo at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time\r\npresses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of\r\nthe essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put\r\nbefore so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so\r\nmomentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\" He looked at me keenly, and\r\nseeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised\r\nthem closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--",
    "\"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\"",
    "\"You have,\" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.\r\nThere was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--",
    "\"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for\r\nthis concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore\r\nin such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I\r\nam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I\r\nassure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and\r\nunselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,\r\nsir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which\r\nanimate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of\r\nyour friends.\" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing\r\nconviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was\r\nbut yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let\r\nhim go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like\r\nall lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at\r\nhim with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting\r\nwith the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone\r\nwhich did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it\r\nafterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--",
    "\"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free\r\nto-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,\r\nwithout prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.\r\nSeward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the\r\nprivilege you seek.\" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of\r\npoignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--",
    "\"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the\r\nhighest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete\r\nreasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since\r\nyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If\r\nyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can\r\nwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help\r\nus; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\" He still shook\r\nhis head as he said:--",
    "\"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and\r\nif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my\r\nown master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am\r\nrefused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\" I thought it was now\r\ntime to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went\r\ntowards the door, simply saying:--",
    "\"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.\"",
    "As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He\r\nmoved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was\r\nabout to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were\r\ngroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\r\npetition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his\r\nemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\r\nrelations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,\r\nand saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more\r\nfixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his\r\nefforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same\r\nconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of\r\nwhich at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he\r\nwanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same\r\nsullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,\r\nfor, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into\r\nquite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up\r\nhis hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a\r\ntorrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his\r\nwhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--",
    "\"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out\r\nof this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;\r\nsend keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a\r\nstrait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go\r\nout of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am\r\nspeaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know\r\nwhom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.\r\nBy all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is\r\nlost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out\r\nof this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you\r\nunderstand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and\r\nearnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting\r\nfor his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!\"",
    "I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\r\nwould bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.",
    "\"Come,\" I said sternly, \"no more of this; we have had quite enough\r\nalready. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\"",
    "He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,\r\nwithout a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the\r\nbed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had\r\nexpected.",
    "When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a\r\nquiet, well-bred voice:--",
    "\"You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later\r\non, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.\"",
    "JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL",
    "_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy\r\nmind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am\r\nso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.\r\nSomehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at\r\nall; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and\r\nbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way\r\nthat every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and\r\nthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a\r\nlittle upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his\r\nroom we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said\r\nto Dr. Seward:--",
    "\"Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the\r\nsanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some\r\nserious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a\r\nchance.\" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--",
    "\"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,\r\nfor I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last\r\nhysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in\r\nour present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.\r\nAll is best as they are.\" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a\r\ndreamy kind of way:--",
    "\"I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an\r\nordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he\r\nseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am\r\nafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how\r\nhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my\r\nthroat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and\r\nmaster,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.\r\nThat horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help\r\nhim, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He\r\ncertainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is\r\nbest. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,\r\nhelp to unnerve a man.\" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand\r\non his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--",
    "\"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad\r\nand terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to\r\nhope for, except the pity of the good God?\" Lord Godalming had slipped\r\naway for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver\r\nwhistle, as he remarked:--",
    "\"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on\r\ncall.\" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care\r\nto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\r\nout. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out\r\na lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\r\nlittle groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--",
    "\"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\r\nmany kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the\r\nstrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are\r\nof the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not\r\namenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong\r\nin all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him\r\nas we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his\r\ntouch. Keep this near your heart\"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver\r\ncrucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--\"put these\r\nflowers round your neck\"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered\r\ngarlic blossoms--\"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this\r\nknife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can\r\nfasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,\r\nwhich we must not desecrate needless.\" This was a portion of Sacred\r\nWafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others\r\nwas similarly equipped. \"Now,\" he said, \"friend John, where are the\r\nskeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house\r\nby the window, as before at Miss Lucy's.\"",
    "Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a\r\nsurgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after\r\na little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty\r\nclang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and\r\nit slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in\r\nDr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that\r\nthe same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they\r\nshrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped\r\ninto the open door.",
    "\"_In manus tuas, Domine!_\" he said, crossing himself as he passed over\r\nthe threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\r\nlit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The\r\nProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it\r\nfrom within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our\r\nlamps and proceeded on our search.",
    "The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\r\nrays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\r\nshadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\r\nwas some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so\r\npowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible\r\nexperience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,\r\nfor I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every\r\nsound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.",
    "The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches\r\ndeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down\r\nmy lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The\r\nwalls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of\r\nspider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old\r\ntattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the\r\nhall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They\r\nhad been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents\r\nin the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor\r\nlifted them. He turned to me and said:--",
    "\"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know\r\nit at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?\" I had an\r\nidea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to\r\nget admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings\r\nfound myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.\r\n\"This is the spot,\" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small\r\nmap of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence\r\nregarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the\r\nbunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for\r\nas we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale\r\nthrough the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we\r\nencountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close\r\nquarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of\r\nhis existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in\r\na ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and\r\nclose, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was\r\nan earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler\r\nair. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not\r\nalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the\r\npungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had\r\nbecome itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath\r\nexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and\r\nintensified its loathsomeness.",
    "Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\r\nenterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\r\nterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose\r\nabove merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking\r\nconsequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our\r\nwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.",
    "We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we\r\nbegan:--",
    "\"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then\r\nexamine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some\r\nclue as to what has become of the rest.\" A glance was sufficient to show\r\nhow many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was\r\nno mistaking them.",
    "There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,\r\nfor, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted\r\ndoor into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my\r\nheart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to\r\nsee the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the\r\nred eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,\r\nas Lord Godalming said, \"I thought I saw a face, but it was only the\r\nshadows,\" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,\r\nand stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there\r\nwere no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid\r\nwalls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I\r\ntook it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.",
    "A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which\r\nhe was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for\r\nundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass\r\nof phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew\r\nback. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.",
    "For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was\r\nseemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great\r\niron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,\r\nand which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the\r\nhuge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver\r\nwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered\r\nfrom behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a\r\nminute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.\r\nUnconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I\r\nnoticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been\r\ntaken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had\r\nelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to\r\nswarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their\r\nmoving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look\r\nlike a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the\r\nthreshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting\r\ntheir noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were\r\nmultiplying in thousands, and we moved out.",
    "Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\r\non the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\r\nrecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before\r\nhim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other\r\ndogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey\r\nere the whole mass had vanished.",
    "With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\r\nthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\r\ntheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\r\nthe air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.\r\nWhether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of\r\nthe chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves\r\nin the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to\r\nslip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something\r\nof its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our\r\nresolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and\r\nbringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found\r\nnothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all\r\nuntouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.\r\nNever once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when\r\nwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been\r\nrabbit-hunting in a summer wood.",
    "The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.\r\nDr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and\r\nlocked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket\r\nwhen he had done.",
    "\"So far,\" he said, \"our night has been eminently successful. No harm has\r\ncome to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how\r\nmany boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our\r\nfirst--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been\r\naccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or\r\ntroubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and\r\nsmells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have\r\nlearned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute\r\nbeasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable\r\nto his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his\r\ncall, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and\r\nto that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell\r\nfrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters\r\nbefore us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used\r\nhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.\r\nSo be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity\r\nto cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the\r\nstake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,\r\nand we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be\r\nordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;\r\nbut we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\"",
    "The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\r\nwas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound\r\nfrom Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,\r\nafter the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.",
    "I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so\r\nsoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than\r\nusual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly\r\nthankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our\r\ndeliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not\r\nthink so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is\r\nsettled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet\r\nto conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she\r\nsuspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a\r\nsealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all\r\nis finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I\r\ndaresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such\r\nconfidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep\r\ndark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that\r\nhas happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.",

    "_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all\r\noverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no\r\nrest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept\r\ntill the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or\r\nthree times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a\r\nfew seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of\r\nblank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She\r\ncomplained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the\r\nday. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be\r\nthat several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace\r\nthem all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the\r\nsooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas\r\nSnelling to-day.",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor\r\nwalking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it\r\nis quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the\r\nbrooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the\r\nnight he suddenly said:--",
    "\"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him\r\nthis morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may\r\nbe. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,\r\nand reason so sound.\" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him\r\nthat if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to\r\nkeep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary\r\ninstructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against\r\ngetting any false impression from my patient. \"But,\" he answered, \"I\r\nwant him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live\r\nthings. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that\r\nhe had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?\"",
    "\"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but the answer is here.\" I laid my hand on the\r\ntype-written matter. \"When our sane and learned lunatic made that very\r\nstatement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually\r\nnauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.\r\nHarker entered the room.\" Van Helsing smiled in turn. \"Good!\" he said.\r\n\"Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it\r\nis this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease\r\nsuch a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the\r\nfolly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.\r\nWho knows?\" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in\r\nhand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was\r\nVan Helsing back in the study. \"Do I interrupt?\" he asked politely as he\r\nstood at the door.",
    "\"Not at all,\" I answered. \"Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.\r\nI can go with you now, if you like.",
    "\"It is needless; I have seen him!\"",
    "\"Well?\"",
    "\"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.\r\nWhen I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with\r\nhis elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen\r\ndiscontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a\r\nmeasure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. \"Don't\r\nyou know me?\" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: \"I know you well\r\nenough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself\r\nand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed\r\nDutchmen!\" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable\r\nsullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at\r\nall. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so\r\nclever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few\r\nhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does\r\nrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be\r\nworried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it\r\nis better so.\"",
    "\"I agree with you with all my heart,\" I answered earnestly, for I did\r\nnot want him to weaken in this matter. \"Mrs. Harker is better out of it.\r\nThings are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have\r\nbeen in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,\r\nand if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time\r\ninfallibly have wrecked her.\"",
    "So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey\r\nand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I\r\nshall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.",
    "_Mina Harker's Journal._",
    "_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;\r\nafter Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him\r\nmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This\r\nmorning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though\r\nJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went\r\nout, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of\r\nwhat had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must\r\nhave known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it\r\nmust have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that\r\nit was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and\r\nI acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am\r\ncrying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great\r\nlove and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.",
    "That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and\r\nlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept\r\nanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has\r\nfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my\r\nheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and\r\nlow-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible\r\nexcitement.",
    "Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told\r\nme to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I\r\nkept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to\r\nsee me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate\r\npressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does\r\nseems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which\r\nis most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear\r\nLucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard\r\ntill I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she\r\nwouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at\r\nnight and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.\r\nOh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what\r\nhas come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew\r\nthat I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my\r\nown account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear\r\nfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do\r\nfeel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons\r\nthat we poor women have to learn....",
    "I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing\r\nthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying\r\non a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere\r\nunder this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so\r\nprofound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.\r\nAll was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight\r\nseeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be\r\nstirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin\r\nstreak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness\r\nacross the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a\r\nvitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must\r\nhave done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy\r\ncreeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out\r\nand looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now\r\nclose up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the\r\nwall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was\r\nmore loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,\r\nI could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on\r\nhis part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\r\nattendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into\r\nbed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.\r\nI was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have\r\nfallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the\r\nmorning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a\r\nlittle time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\r\nbending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of\r\nthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.",
    "I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I\r\nwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my\r\nhands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the\r\nusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn\r\nupon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the\r\nclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim\r\naround. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\r\ncame only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\r\ngrown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I\r\nhad shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to\r\nmake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\r\nlimbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed\r\nmy eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what\r\ntricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The\r\nmist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I\r\ncould see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling\r\nwater--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of\r\nthe door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\r\nconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top\r\nof which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things\r\nbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\r\nwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \"a\r\npillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\" Was it indeed some such\r\nspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was\r\ncomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\r\nred eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I\r\nlooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like\r\ntwo red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering\r\nwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's\r\nChurch. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan\r\nhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist\r\nin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became\r\nblack darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to\r\nshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be\r\ncareful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were\r\ntoo much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe\r\nsomething for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm\r\nthem. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their\r\nfears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do\r\nnot, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that\r\ncannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last\r\nnight tired me more than if I had not slept at all.",

    "_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have\r\nslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the\r\nsleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and\r\nspiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was\r\nvery gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless\r\nme. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This\r\nis a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be\r\nmiserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till\r\ndinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten\r\nthem up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how\r\ntired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke\r\ntogether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other\r\nof what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's\r\nmanner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so\r\nsleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to\r\ngive me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night\r\nbefore. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to\r\nme, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I\r\nhave taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope\r\nI have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear\r\ncomes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the\r\npower of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.",
    "JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL",
    "_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal\r\nGreen, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The\r\nvery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had\r\nproved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I\r\nlearned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he\r\nwas only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the\r\nresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph\r\nSmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a\r\nsaucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable\r\ntype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all\r\nabout the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared\r\nnotebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the\r\nseat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,\r\nhalf-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There\r\nwere, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at\r\n197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he\r\ndeposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to\r\nscatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were\r\nchosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more\r\nfully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that\r\nhe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now\r\nfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern\r\nshore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to\r\nbe left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the\r\nvery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back\r\nto Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had\r\nbeen taken from Carfax.",
    "He replied:--",
    "\"Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some\"--I had given him half a\r\nsovereign--\"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of\r\nBloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,\r\nas 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at\r\nPurfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'\r\nthat maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.\" I asked if he could tell me\r\nwhere to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it\r\nwould be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest\r\nof his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search\r\nthen and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--",
    "\"Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I\r\nmay find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way\r\nto tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.\r\nIf you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on\r\nit, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But\r\nye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch\r\n'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.\"",
    "This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to\r\nbuy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she\r\ncame back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had\r\nagain faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way\r\nto home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.\r\nMina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as\r\nthough she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be\r\nkept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the\r\nothers. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and\r\nworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors\r\nwere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful\r\nbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence\r\nmust rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any\r\ncircumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she\r\nherself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the\r\nCount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.",

    "_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first\r\npost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on\r\nwhich was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--",
    "\"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for\r\nthe depite.\"",
    "I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy\r\nand sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,\r\nbut that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for\r\nher going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,\r\nwith her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and\r\nin ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I\r\nwas off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should\r\nhave found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some\r\ndifficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked\r\nfor Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found\r\nthe court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.\r\nWhen I asked the man who came to the door for the \"depite,\" he shook his\r\nhead, and said: \"I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never\r\n'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody\r\nof that kind livin' ere or anywheres.\" I took out Smollet's letter, and\r\nas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name\r\nof the court might guide me. \"What are you?\" I asked.",
    "\"I'm the depity,\" he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right\r\ntrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the\r\ndeputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who\r\nhad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\r\nCorcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that\r\nmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\r\nhe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \"new-fangled ware'us\";\r\nand with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve\r\no'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\r\nI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One\r\nof these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a\r\nnew \"cold storage\" building; and as this suited the condition of a\r\n\"new-fangled ware'us,\" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly\r\ngatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the\r\ncoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\r\nsuggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for\r\nthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was\r\na smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had\r\npromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\r\nthat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\r\nand had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--\"main\r\nheavy ones\"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I\r\nasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\r\nwhich he replied:--",
    "\"Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a\r\nbig white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a\r\ndusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we\r\ntooked the bloomin' boxes from.\"",
    "\"How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?\"",
    "\"There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse at\r\nPurfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse\r\nme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,\r\nwith a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw\r\na shadder.\"",
    "How this phrase thrilled through me!",
    "\"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\r\nme a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm no\r\nchicken, neither.\"",
    "\"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\" I asked.",
    "\"He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for\r\nwhen I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me\r\nto carry the boxes into the 'all.\"",
    "\"The whole nine?\" I asked.",
    "\"Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was\r\nmain dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome.\" I\r\ninterrupted him:--",
    "\"Were the boxes left in the hall?\"",
    "\"Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it.\" I made one\r\nmore attempt to further matters:--",
    "\"You didn't have any key?\"",
    "\"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself\r\nan' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--but\r\nthat was the beer.\"",
    "\"And you can't remember the number of the house?\"",
    "\"No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un\r\nwith a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I\r\nknow them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\r\nwhat come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'\r\nthey seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them\r\nby the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot\r\nof them went away cussin'.\" I thought that with this description I could\r\nfind the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started\r\noff for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count\r\ncould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was\r\nprecious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of\r\ndistribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task\r\nunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked\r\nwestward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house\r\ndescribed, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs\r\narranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long\r\nuntenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\r\nup. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint\r\nhad mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been\r\na large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been\r\nroughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.\r\nBehind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,\r\nwhose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have\r\nbeen able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have\r\ngiven some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my\r\nexperience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not\r\nbut feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means\r\ndiscovered of gaining access to the house.",
    "There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and\r\nnothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything\r\ncould be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the\r\nPiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the\r\ngrooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything\r\nabout the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been\r\ntaken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to\r\nvery lately there had been a notice-board of \"For Sale\" up, and that\r\nperhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me\r\nsomething, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on\r\nthe board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know\r\nor guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\r\naway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I\r\ndid not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &\r\nCandy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\r\nSackville Street.",
    "The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\r\nuncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the\r\nPiccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a\r\n\"mansion\"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I\r\nasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\r\npaused a few seconds before replying:--",
    "\"It is sold, sir.\"",
    "\"Pardon me,\" I said, with equal politeness, \"but I have a special reason\r\nfor wishing to know who purchased it.\"",
    "Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \"It is sold,\r\nsir,\" was again his laconic reply.",
    "\"Surely,\" I said, \"you do not mind letting me know so much.\"",
    "\"But I do mind,\" he answered. \"The affairs of their clients are\r\nabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\" This was\r\nmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\r\nhim. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--",
    "\"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\r\nconfidence. I am myself a professional man.\" Here I handed him my card.\r\n\"In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\r\nLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\r\nhe understood, lately for sale.\" These words put a different complexion\r\non affairs. He said:--",
    "\"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would\r\nI like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of\r\nrenting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\r\nHolmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult\r\nthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\r\nlordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far\r\ndeviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\r\nlordship.\"",
    "I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\r\ngave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I\r\nwas tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the A\u00ebrated Bread Company\r\nand came down to Purfleet by the next train.",
    "I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she\r\nmade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to\r\nthink that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\r\ninquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at\r\nour conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\r\nconfidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\r\nkeeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or\r\nelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\r\nany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we\r\nmade our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\r\nknowledge would be torture to her.",
    "I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;\r\nso after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even\r\namongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\r\nThe dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\r\nas though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I\r\ncame away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\r\ndifference between us.",
    "When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\r\nthe study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\r\nit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\r\ninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--",
    "\"This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on\r\nthe track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then\r\nour work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search\r\nuntil we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the\r\nwretch to his real death.\" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.\r\nMorris spoke:--",
    "\"Say! how are we going to get into that house?\"",
    "\"We got into the other,\" answered Lord Godalming quickly.",
    "\"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\r\nand a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to\r\ncommit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't\r\nsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key\r\nof some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the\r\nmorning.\" Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked\r\nabout the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to\r\nanother of us:--",
    "\"Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we\r\ngot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we\r\ncan find the Count's key basket.\"",
    "As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\r\nleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,\r\nwe decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good\r\nwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\r\nbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\r\nmoment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....",
    "Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her\r\nforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\r\nin her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\r\ndid this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\r\nherself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so\r\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\r\nalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\r\nthan interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his\r\nrepulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.\r\nHe was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really\r\ncare for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and\r\nlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I\r\nthought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\r\nhim:--",
    "\"What about the flies these times?\" He smiled on me in quite a superior\r\nsort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as\r\nhe answered me:--",
    "\"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical\r\nof the a\u00ebrial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well\r\nwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!\"",
    "I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\r\nquickly:--",
    "\"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\" His madness foiled his\r\nreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\r\nwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--",
    "\"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\" Here he brightened\r\nup; \"I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I\r\nhave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\r\nstudy zo\u00f6phagy!\"",
    "This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--",
    "\"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\" He smiled with an\r\nineffably benign superiority.",
    "\"Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the\r\nDeity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I\r\nmay state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\r\npurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\r\nspiritually!\" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall\r\nEnoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\r\nthat by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--",
    "\"And why with Enoch?\"",
    "\"Because he walked with God.\" I could not see the analogy, but did not\r\nlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--",
    "\"So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?\" I put\r\nmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\r\nThe effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his\r\nold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as\r\nhe replied:--",
    "\"I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if\r\nI had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them\r\nor----\" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his\r\nface, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. \"And doctor, as to\r\nlife, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you\r\nknow that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good\r\nfriends--like you, Dr. Seward\"; this was said with a leer of\r\ninexpressible cunning. \"I know that I shall never lack the means of\r\nlife!\"",
    "I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some\r\nantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as\r\nhe--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it\r\nwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.",
    "Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come\r\nwithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\r\nthat I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything\r\nto help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are\r\nLord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the\r\nrecord prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate\r\nknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish\r\nto be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with\r\nme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\r\nmight not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield\r\nmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\r\nalone.",
    "I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\r\nwhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I\r\ncame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\r\nlips:--",
    "\"What about souls?\" It was evident then that my surmise had been\r\ncorrect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the\r\nlunatic. I determined to have the matter out. \"What about them\r\nyourself?\" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round\r\nhim, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for\r\nan answer.",
    "\"I don't want any souls!\" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The\r\nmatter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to \"be\r\ncruel only to be kind.\" So I said:--",
    "\"You like life, and you want life?\"",
    "\"Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!\"",
    "\"But,\" I asked, \"how are we to get the life without getting the soul\r\nalso?\" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--",
    "\"A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with\r\nthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing\r\nand twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you\r\nknow, and you must put up with their souls!\" Something seemed to affect\r\nhis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\r\nscrewing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\r\nsoaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\r\nme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,\r\nthough the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It\r\nwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\r\nand, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\r\nto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\r\ngo with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,\r\nspeaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--",
    "\"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?\" He seemed to\r\nwake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--",
    "\"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!\" After a pause he added,\r\n\"But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\"",
    "\"Or spiders?\" I went on.",
    "\"Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them\r\nto eat or\"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\r\ntopic.",
    "\"So, so!\" I thought to myself, \"this is the second time he has suddenly\r\nstopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?\" Renfield seemed himself\r\naware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract\r\nmy attention from it:--",
    "\"I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such\r\nsmall deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' they\r\nmight be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well\r\nask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to\r\ninterest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before\r\nme.\"",
    "\"I see,\" I said. \"You want big things that you can make your teeth meet\r\nin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?\"",
    "\"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!\" He was getting too wide\r\nawake, so I thought I would press him hard. \"I wonder,\" I said\r\nreflectively, \"what an elephant's soul is like!\"",
    "The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\r\nhigh-horse and became a child again.",
    "\"I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!\" he said. For a\r\nfew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\r\nhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \"To\r\nhell with you and your souls!\" he shouted. \"Why do you plague me about\r\nsouls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\r\nwithout thinking of souls!\" He looked so hostile that I thought he was\r\nin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,\r\nhowever, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--",
    "\"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so\r\nworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the\r\nproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and\r\ntolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I\r\nwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am\r\nsure you will understand!\" He had evidently self-control; so when the\r\nattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield\r\nwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\r\ndignity and sweetness:--",
    "\"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that\r\nI am very, very grateful to you!\" I thought it well to leave him in this\r\nmood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in\r\nthis man's state. Several points seem to make what the American\r\ninterviewer calls \"a story,\" if one could only get them in proper order.\r\nHere they are:--",
    "Will not mention \"drinking.\"",
    "Fears the thought of being burdened with the \"soul\" of anything.",
    "Has no dread of wanting \"life\" in the future.",
    "Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being\r\nhaunted by their souls.",
    "Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind\r\nthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the\r\nburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!",
    "And the assurance--?",
    "Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of\r\nterror afoot!",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my\r\nsuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a\r\nwhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door\r\nwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time\r\nwhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that\r\nhe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the\r\nautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk\r\nof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He\r\nwent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had\r\ngot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come\r\naway as ignorant as we went in.",

    "_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to\r\nmake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,\r\nand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he\r\nwas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire\r\nin the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts\r\nand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,\r\nand we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.",
    "Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in\r\nthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart\r\nrose and fell with regular respiration.",
    "This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight\r\nhe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him\r\nif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was\r\nsomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if\r\nhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \"dozed\" for\r\na while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are\r\nwatched.",
    "To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are\r\nlooking after horses.

We must sterilise all the imported\r\nearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his\r\nweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the\r\nBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine.

When I went to move him, it\r\nbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;\r\nthere seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body\r\nwhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see\r\nthat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the\r\nfloor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\r\noriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\r\nwe turned him over:--",
    "\"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\r\nthe whole side of his face are paralysed.\" How such a thing could have\r\nhappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite\r\nbewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--",
    "\"I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by\r\nbeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the\r\nEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he\r\nmight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward\r\nkink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things\r\noccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his\r\nface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of\r\nit.\" I said to him:--",
    "\"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want\r\nhim without an instant's delay.\" The man ran off, and within a few\r\nminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\r\nhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\r\nthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\r\nsaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--",
    "\"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much\r\nattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.\r\nIf you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"",
    "The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\r\nhe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with\r\nextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had\r\nevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\r\nlooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--",
    "\"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\r\nconscious, after the operation.\" So I said:--",
    "\"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\r\npresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\r\nLet me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"",
    "The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\r\nThe wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\r\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\r\nProfessor thought a moment and said:--",
    "\"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\r\nas can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\r\nhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\r\nbrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\r\ntoo late.\" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\r\nwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\r\nQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--",
    "\"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\r\nSo I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\r\nare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\r\nthese times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\r\nas they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more\r\nthan we have done. May we come in?\" I nodded, and held the door open\r\ntill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\r\nattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\r\nfloor, he said softly:--",
    "\"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\" I told him\r\nbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\r\nthe operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\r\ndown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\r\nin patience.",
    "\"We shall wait,\" said Van Helsing, \"just long enough to fix the best\r\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\r\nthe blood clot; for it is evident that the h\u00e6morrhage is increasing.\"",
    "The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\r\nhorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered\r\nthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\r\nthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\r\nbut the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\r\nwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in\r\nuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\r\nand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\r\nwould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\r\nbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\r\nhear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\r\ntemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\r\nagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\r\ntheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\r\ntorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\r\nsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\r\nit.",
    "At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\r\nsinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\r\nand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\r\nspoke:--",
    "\"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\r\nbeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\r\nWe shall operate just above the ear.\"",
    "Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\r\nbreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\r\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\r\nSuddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\r\nThis was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\r\nsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\r\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--",
    "\"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\r\nhave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\r\nmove. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\r\ndreadfully.\" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\r\neyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\r\nHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:--",
    "\"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\" As he heard the voice his face\r\nbrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--",
    "\"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\r\nwater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\"--he\r\nstopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--\"The\r\nbrandy--it is in my study--quick!\" He flew and returned with a glass,\r\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\r\nlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\r\ninjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\r\nconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\r\nshall never forget, and said:--",
    "\"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\"\r\nThen his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\r\nfigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--",
    "\"If I were not sure already, I would know from them.\" For an instant his\r\neyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\r\nbringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\r\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--",
    "\"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\r\nand then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\r\nagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\r\ncrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\r\nme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I\r\nfelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\r\nI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\r\nme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\r\nseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\r\ndogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\" As he spoke, Van\r\nHelsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\r\ngripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\r\nand said: \"Go on,\" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--",
    "\"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\r\nbut he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\r\nman's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\r\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\r\nof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in\r\nat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.\r\nThen he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\" He\r\nwas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--",
    "\"How?\"",
    "\"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\r\nsun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\r\nwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\r\nbacks.\" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--",
    "\"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\r\n'Death's-head Moth'?\" The patient went on without stopping.",
    "\"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\r\nmillions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\r\ntoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\r\nbuzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\r\nThen the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\r\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\r\nhands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\r\nspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\r\nthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\r\nwere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\r\nsmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\r\nseemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\r\nand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\r\nme!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\r\nover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\r\nthe sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were\r\nall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\r\nopen an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\r\nthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\r\nsplendour.\"",
    "His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\r\nhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\r\nthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\r\nback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him go on. Do\r\nnot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\r\nif once he lost the thread of his thought.\" He proceeded:--",
    "\"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\r\neven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\r\nWhen he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\r\nknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\r\nout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\r\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same\r\nas he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\r\nHarker had come into the room.\"",
    "The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\r\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\r\nThey were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\r\nhowever, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\r\nnoticing:--",
    "\"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;\r\nit was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\" Here we all moved,\r\nbut no one said a word; he went on:--",
    "\"I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the\r\nsame. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\r\nin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it\r\nat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\r\nto know that He had been taking the life out of her.\" I could feel that\r\nthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \"So when\r\nHe came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\r\ngrabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\r\nas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.\r\nAy, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\r\nwith me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't\r\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned\r\ninto me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and\r\nwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There\r\nwas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\r\nto steal away under the door.\" His voice was becoming fainter and his\r\nbreath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.",
    "\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose.\r\nIt may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\r\nnight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\" There was no\r\nneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\r\ncommon. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\r\nhad when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and\r\nas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--",
    "\"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\r\nover. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.\r\nAlas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped; his\r\nvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\r\nmy own heart.",
    "Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the\r\nlatter said:--",
    "\"Should we disturb her?\"",
    "\"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall\r\nbreak it in.\"",
    "\"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's\r\nroom!\"",
    "Van Helsing said solemnly, \"You are always right; but this is life and\r\ndeath. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they\r\nare all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if\r\nthe door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you\r\ntoo, my friends. Now!\"",
    "He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\r\nourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\r\nheadlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\r\nacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw\r\nappalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\r\nand my heart seemed to stand still.",
    "The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\r\nwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\r\nHarker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\r\nKneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\r\nfigure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.\r\nHis face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\r\nthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\r\nhand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms\r\nat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\r\nforcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared\r\nwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which\r\nwas shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible\r\nresemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to\r\ncompel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\r\nface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\r\ninto it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\r\nof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\r\nwhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\r\nchamped together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw\r\nhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\r\nand sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\r\nand was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\r\nWafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\r\nthe tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,\r\nlifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\r\ngreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\r\nunder Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\r\nlooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\r\nopen, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\r\nforward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\r\nit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\r\nseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a\r\nfew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was\r\nghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\r\nher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\r\nblood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her\r\npoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\r\nCount's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\r\nwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\r\nendless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\r\nover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\r\ndespairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--",
    "\"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\r\ndo nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\r\nherself; I must wake him!\" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\r\nand with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while\r\nholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was\r\nheart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the\r\nwindow. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\r\nMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\r\nyew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the\r\ninstant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial\r\nconsciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well\r\nbe, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and\r\nthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he\r\nstarted up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to\r\nhim with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,\r\nhowever, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held\r\nher hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.",
    "\"In God's name what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr.\r\nVan Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\r\nwhat is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\r\nthis!\" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\r\ntogether. \"Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!\" With a quick\r\nmovement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the\r\nman in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened?\r\nTell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, you\r\nlove Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\r\nfar yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!\" His wife, through her terror\r\nand horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly\r\nforgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--",
    "\"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\r\nto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\r\nwith me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" Her\r\nexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\r\npulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.",
    "Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\r\nlittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--",
    "\"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\r\nfoul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm\r\nand take counsel together.\" She shuddered and was silent, holding down\r\nher head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white\r\nnight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\r\nthe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she\r\nsaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\r\nsobs:--",
    "\"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\r\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\r\nmost cause to fear.\" To this he spoke out resolutely:--",
    "\"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\r\nhear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\r\ndeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\r\nif by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\" He put out\r\nhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\r\nsobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\r\ndamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a\r\nwhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to\r\nme, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\r\npower to the utmost:--",
    "\"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\r\nfact; tell me all that has been.\" I told him exactly what had happened,\r\nand he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\r\nand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\r\nheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\r\nthe open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to\r\nsee, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\r\nthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\r\nhair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\r\nThey entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\r\nquestioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of\r\ntheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband\r\nand wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence\r\nto him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\r\nanswered:--",
    "\"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I\r\nlooked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,\r\nhowever----\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\r\nthe bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--",
    "\"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\r\nis in knowing all. Tell freely!\" So Art went on:--",
    "\"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\r\nseconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been\r\nburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the\r\ncylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax\r\nhad helped the flames.\" Here I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the\r\nother copy in the safe!\" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\r\nwent on: \"I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked\r\ninto Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!\" Again he\r\npaused. \"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\r\nmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: \"except that the poor fellow\r\nis dead.\" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\r\nus she said solemnly:--",
    "\"God's will be done!\" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\r\nsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\r\nVan Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--",
    "\"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\"",
    "\"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I\r\ncan't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\r\ngo when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\r\nRenfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some\r\nshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He\r\nwill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\r\ndawn is close. We must work to-morrow!\"",
    "He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps\r\na couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\r\nhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\r\nhand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--",
    "\"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\r\nhappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\r\nneed that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done\r\nquick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must\r\nend all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and\r\nlearn.\"",
    "The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\r\nas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\r\nlower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held\r\nout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and\r\nkissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that\r\nof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.\r\nAfter a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\r\nbegan:--",
    "\"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a\r\nlong time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads\r\nof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\r\nconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\"\r\nHer husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\r\nlovingly: \"Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me\r\nthrough the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me\r\nto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\r\nneed your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work\r\nwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\r\nsleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no\r\nmore. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\r\nnext I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I\r\nhad before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find\r\nit in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague\r\nterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.\r\nI turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\r\nseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I\r\ntried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I\r\nlooked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside\r\nthe bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist\r\nhad turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a\r\ntall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of\r\nthe others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light\r\nfell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white\r\nteeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the\r\nsunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the\r\nred scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant\r\nmy heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\r\nparalysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\r\npointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--",
    "\"'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\r\nbefore your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\r\nsay anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\r\nand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\r\nso, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well\r\nbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\r\nappeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\r\nwant to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\r\nsuch is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity\r\nme! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\" Her husband groaned\r\nagain. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\r\nhe were the injured one, and went on:--",
    "\"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long\r\nthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\r\nmust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I\r\nsaw it drip with the fresh blood!\" The remembrance seemed for a while to\r\noverpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\r\nhusband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and\r\nwent on:--",
    "\"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play\r\nyour brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and\r\nfrustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,\r\nand will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They\r\nshould have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\r\nplayed wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued\r\nfor them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were\r\nborn--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now\r\nto me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful\r\nwine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my\r\nhelper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\r\nminister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you\r\nhave done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\r\ncall. When my brain says \"Come!\" to you, you shall cross land or sea to\r\ndo my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his\r\nshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When\r\nthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\r\nthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\r\nthe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh\r\nmy God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a\r\nfate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\r\ndays. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;\r\nand in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!\" Then she began to rub her\r\nlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.",
    "As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,\r\nand everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;\r\nbut over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look\r\nwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first\r\nred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out\r\nagainst the whitening hair.",
    "We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy\r\npair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.",
    "Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in\r\nall the great round of its daily course.",
    "JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL",
    "_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It\r\nis now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\r\ntake something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed\r\nthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God\r\nknows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\r\nnot stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\r\nthe little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could\r\nnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,\r\nwe must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\r\nrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\r\nfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\r\nup to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!",
    "When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\r\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward\r\ntold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\r\nthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was\r\nall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.",
    "Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\r\nheard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\r\nhalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\r\nhad called out loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" after that there\r\nwas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\r\non the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing\r\nasked if he had heard \"voices\" or \"a voice,\" and he said he could not\r\nsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\r\nthere was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear\r\nto it, if required, that the word \"God\" was spoken by the patient. Dr.\r\nSeward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\r\nthe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\r\nwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As\r\nit was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a\r\ncertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the\r\ncoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\r\nto the same result.",
    "When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\r\nstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\r\nconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\r\nkept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful\r\nto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of\r\ndespair. \"There must be no concealment,\" she said, \"Alas! we have had\r\ntoo much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\r\ngive me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!\r\nWhatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\"\r\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\r\nbut quietly:--",
    "\"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\r\nothers from yourself, after what has happened?\" Her face grew set in its\r\nlines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\r\nanswered:--",
    "\"Ah no! for my mind is made up!\"",
    "\"To what?\" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\r\nour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer\r\ncame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--",
    "\"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\r\nharm to any that I love, I shall die!\"",
    "\"You would not kill yourself?\" he asked, hoarsely.",
    "\"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a\r\npain, and so desperate an effort!\" She looked at him meaningly as she\r\nspoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\r\nput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:",
    "\"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I\r\ncould hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,\r\neven at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my\r\nchild----\" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\r\nthroat; he gulped it down and went on:--",
    "\"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not\r\ndie. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until\r\nthe other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not\r\ndie; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make\r\nyou even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to\r\nlive, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death\r\nhimself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the\r\nnight; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you\r\ndo not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.\" The\r\npoor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a\r\nquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all\r\nsilent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to\r\nhim said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--",
    "\"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\r\nstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may\r\nhave passed away from me.\" She was so good and brave that we all felt\r\nthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we\r\nbegan to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all\r\nthe papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we\r\nmight hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.\r\nShe was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if \"pleased\" could\r\nbe used in connection with so grim an interest.",
    "As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\r\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.",
    "\"It is perhaps well,\" he said, \"that at our meeting after our visit to\r\nCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay\r\nthere. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\r\nwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\r\neffort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\r\nintentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a\r\npower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use\r\nthem as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as\r\nto their disposition that, when we have examined the house in\r\nPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;\r\nand in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\r\nguards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must\r\nretain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations\r\nof his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\r\nthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he\r\nmust open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out\r\nall his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch\r\nhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\r\nand the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\" Here I started up for I\r\ncould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\r\npreciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,\r\nsince whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up\r\nhis hand warningly. \"Nay, friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this, the\r\nquickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all\r\nact and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in\r\nall probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.\r\nThe Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have\r\ndeeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he\r\nwrite on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings\r\nthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\r\nwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\r\nvery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and\r\nsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\r\nfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we\r\nrun down our old fox--so? is it not?\"",
    "\"Then let us come at once,\" I cried, \"we are wasting the precious,\r\nprecious time!\" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--",
    "\"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\"",
    "\"Any way!\" I cried. \"We shall break in if need be.\"",
    "\"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\"",
    "I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\r\nreason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--",
    "\"Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\r\nin.\"",
    "\"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\r\nyour anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\r\nmovement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it\r\nseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get\r\ninto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\" I nodded.",
    "\"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could\r\nnot still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the\r\nhousebreaker, what would you do?\"",
    "\"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\r\nlock for me.\"",
    "\"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?\"",
    "\"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.\"",
    "\"Then,\" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \"all that is in doubt is\r\nthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to\r\nwhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your\r\npolice must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading\r\nthe heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my\r\nfriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this\r\nyour London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such\r\nthings are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,\r\nno one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine\r\nhouse in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland\r\nand lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and\r\ngot in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out\r\nand in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he\r\nhave an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;\r\nand when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of\r\nthat other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him\r\nthat house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away\r\nwithin a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all\r\nthey can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland\r\nhe find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done\r\n_en r\u00e8gle_; and in our work we shall be _en r\u00e8gle_ too. We shall not go\r\nso early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem\r\nit strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many\r\nabout, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the\r\nhouse.\"",
    "I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's\r\nface became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van\r\nHelsing went on:--",
    "\"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of\r\nus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be\r\nmore earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.\"",
    "Lord Godalming stood up. \"I can be of some use here,\" he said. \"I shall\r\nwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most\r\nconvenient.\"",
    "\"Look here, old fellow,\" said Morris, \"it is a capital idea to have all\r\nready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one\r\nof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of\r\nWalworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?\r\nIt seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and\r\neven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.\"",
    "\"Friend Quincey is right!\" said the Professor. \"His head is what you\r\ncall in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to\r\ndo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.\"",
    "Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see\r\nthat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\r\nterrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost\r\nghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in\r\nsomewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give\r\nher needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of\r\nwhat had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As\r\nyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet\r\nwas short, and there was time for fear.",
    "When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the\r\ndisposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was\r\nfinally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the\r\nCount's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we\r\nshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his\r\npresence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us\r\nsome new clue.",
    "As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\r\nafter our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;\r\nthat the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming\r\nand Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.\r\nIt was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count\r\nmight appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be\r\nable to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to\r\nfollow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as\r\nmy going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect\r\nMina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would\r\nnot listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter\r\nin which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be\r\nsome clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;\r\nand that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to\r\ncope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's\r\nresolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that\r\nwe should all work together. \"As for me,\" she said, \"I have no fear.\r\nThings have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must\r\nhave in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if\r\nHe wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.\" So I\r\nstarted up crying out: \"Then in God's name let us come at once, for we\r\nare losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we\r\nthink.\"",
    "\"Not so!\" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.",
    "\"But why?\" I asked.",
    "\"Do you forget,\" he said, with actually a smile, \"that last night he\r\nbanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?\"",
    "Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that\r\nterrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but\r\nthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and\r\nshuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her\r\nfrightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in\r\nthe affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,\r\nhe was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. \"Oh,\r\nMadam Mina,\" he said, \"dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so\r\nreverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old\r\nlips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will\r\nforget it, will you not?\" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took\r\nhis hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--",
    "\"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I\r\nhave so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all\r\ntogether. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we\r\nmust all eat that we may be strong.\"",
    "Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and\r\nencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\r\nus. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--",
    "\"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we\r\nall armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's\r\nlair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?\" We all assured\r\nhim. \"Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe\r\nhere until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall\r\nreturn! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I\r\nhave myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing\r\nof things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard\r\nyourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the\r\nname of the Father, the Son, and----\"",
    "There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he\r\nhad placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned\r\ninto the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor\r\ndarling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as\r\nher nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that\r\nher overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the\r\nwords to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased\r\nto ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her\r\nknees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair\r\nover her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--",
    "\"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must\r\nbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.\" They\r\nall paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless\r\ngrief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our\r\nsorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away\r\ntheir eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said\r\ngravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some\r\nway inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--",
    "\"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,\r\nas He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of\r\nthe earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam\r\nMina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that\r\nred scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,\r\nand leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as\r\nwe live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the\r\nburden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did\r\nin obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of\r\nHis good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other\r\nthrough stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and\r\nfears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.\"",
    "There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.\r\nMina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old\r\nman's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all\r\nknelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each\r\nother. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the\r\nhead of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help\r\nand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.",
    "It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which\r\nneither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.",
    "To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a\r\nvampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible\r\nland alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant\r\nmany; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so\r\nthe holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.",
    "We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on\r\nthe first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic\r\nsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such\r\nfear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there\r\nnot been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded\r\nwith our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and\r\nin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.\r\nDr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--",
    "\"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this\r\nearth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far\r\ndistant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has\r\nbeen holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more\r\nholy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to\r\nGod.\" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and\r\nvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled\r\nmusty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention\r\nwas concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the\r\nSacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down\r\nthe lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.",
    "One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left\r\nthem as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion\r\nof the Host.",
    "When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--",
    "\"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can\r\nbe so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam\r\nMina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!\"",
    "As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our\r\ntrain we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the\r\nwindow of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to\r\ntell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in\r\nreply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her\r\nhand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station\r\nand just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the\r\nplatform.",
    "I have written this in the train.",

    "_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street\r\nLord Godalming said to me:--",
    "\"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in\r\ncase there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it\r\nwouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a\r\nsolicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you\r\nshould have known better.\" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger\r\neven of odium, but he went on: \"Besides, it will attract less attention\r\nif there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with\r\nthe locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had\r\nbetter go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,\r\nsomewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and\r\nthe smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the\r\nlookout for you, and shall let you in.\"",
    "\"The advice is good!\" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming\r\nand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner\r\nof Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green\r\nPark. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was\r\ncentred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst\r\nits more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench\r\nwithin good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little\r\nattention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we\r\nwaited for the coming of the others.",
    "At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely\r\nfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended\r\na thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid\r\nthe cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two\r\nascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.\r\nThe workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes\r\nof the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered\r\nalong. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down\r\nplaced his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a\r\nselection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly\r\nfashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and\r\nturning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and\r\nthe man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he\r\nbegan to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling\r\nabout for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the\r\ndoor opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others\r\nentered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van\r\nHelsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the\r\nworkman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly\r\nopen, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.\r\nThis he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and\r\ngave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his\r\ncoat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole\r\ntransaction.",
    "When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at\r\nthe door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood\r\nLord Godalming lighting a cigar.",
    "\"The place smells so vilely,\" said the latter as we came in. It did\r\nindeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our\r\nprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the\r\nplace pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together\r\nin case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal\r\nwith, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the\r\nhouse. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found\r\neight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!\r\nOur work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the\r\nmissing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out\r\nacross a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,\r\npointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no\r\nwindows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not\r\nlose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had\r\nbrought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had\r\ntreated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the\r\nCount was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for\r\nany of his effects.",
    "After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,\r\nwe came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects\r\nwhich might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine\r\nthem. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room\r\ntable. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;\r\ndeeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;\r\nnote-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin\r\nwrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes\r\nbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing\r\ndirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a\r\nlittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to\r\nthe other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming\r\nand Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the\r\nhouses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great\r\nbunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us\r\nare, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of\r\nthe Count.",
    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY",
    "_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for\r\nthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep\r\nour minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent\r\npurpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.\r\nThe poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.\r\nLast night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful\r\nface, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,\r\nhaggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning\r\neyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in\r\nfact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if\r\nall go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,\r\nin a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I\r\nthought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows\r\nthis well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he\r\nhas been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So\r\nwell as I can remember, here it is:--",
    "\"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all\r\nthe papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the\r\ngreater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there\r\nare signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of\r\nit. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,\r\nhe was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and\r\nalchemist--which latter was the highest development of the\r\nscience-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond\r\ncompare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to\r\nattend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time\r\nthat he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the\r\nphysical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.\r\nIn some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is\r\ngrowing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of\r\nman's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not\r\nbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we\r\nfail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must\r\nlead through Death, not Life.\"",
    "Harker groaned and said, \"And this is all arrayed against my darling!\r\nBut how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\"",
    "\"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\r\nsurely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as\r\nyet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain\r\nthings he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means\r\nto succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait\r\nand to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.\"",
    "\"I fail to understand,\" said Harker wearily. \"Oh, do be more plain to\r\nme! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\"",
    "The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--",
    "\"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this\r\nmonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been\r\nmaking use of the zo\u00f6phagous patient to effect his entry into friend\r\nJohn's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when\r\nand how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by\r\nan inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not\r\nsee how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He\r\nknew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great\r\nchild-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he\r\nmight not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he\r\nfound that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he\r\nprogress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where\r\nthey are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So\r\nthat he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his\r\nform, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his\r\nhiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him\r\njust too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;\r\nand before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he\r\ncan move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is\r\nthere not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even\r\nmore careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be\r\nwell, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our\r\nday, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are\r\nfive of us when those absent ones return.\"",
    "Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the\r\ndouble postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the\r\nhall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to\r\nkeep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a\r\ndespatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the\r\ndirection, opened it and read aloud.",
    "\"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and\r\nhastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want\r\nto see you: Mina.\"",
    "There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--",
    "\"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!\" Van Helsing turned to him\r\nquickly and said:--",
    "\"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice\r\nas yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.\"",
    "\"I care for nothing now,\" he answered hotly, \"except to wipe out this\r\nbrute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!\"",
    "\"Oh, hush, hush, my child!\" said Van Helsing. \"God does not purchase\r\nsouls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep\r\nfaith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your\r\ndevotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be\r\ndoubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are\r\nall devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is\r\ncoming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,\r\nand till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive\r\nhere--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times\r\nbefore he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for\r\nis that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\"",
    "About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there\r\ncame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary\r\nknock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made\r\nthe Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and\r\ntogether moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various\r\narmaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van\r\nHelsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood\r\nback, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts\r\nmust have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we\r\nsaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed\r\nthe door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the\r\nhall:--",
    "\"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we\r\ndestroyed them all!\"",
    "\"Destroyed?\" asked the Professor.",
    "\"For him!\" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--",
    "\"There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up\r\nby five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker\r\nalone after sunset.\"",
    "\"He will be here before long now,\" said Van Helsing, who had been\r\nconsulting his pocket-book. \"_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went\r\nsouth from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could\r\nonly do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one\r\no'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only\r\nsuspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would\r\nsuspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a\r\nshort time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to\r\nMile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be\r\ncarried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not\r\nhave long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that\r\nwe may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your\r\narms! Be ready!\" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could\r\nhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.",
    "I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\r\ndominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and\r\nadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\r\nbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\r\naccustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be\r\nrenewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once\r\nlaid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a\r\ngesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\r\njust behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could\r\nguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.\r\nGodalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to\r\nmove in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the\r\nseconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along\r\nthe hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least\r\nhe feared it.",
    "Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past\r\nus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something\r\nso panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed\r\nto sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was\r\nHarker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door\r\nleading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a\r\nhorrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long\r\nand pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of\r\nlion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single\r\nimpulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some\r\nbetter organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what\r\nwe were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would\r\navail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had\r\nready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The\r\nblow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's\r\nleap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne\r\nthrough his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,\r\nmaking a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold\r\nfell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a\r\nmoment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife\r\naloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a\r\nprotective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I\r\nfelt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I\r\nsaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously\r\nby each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of\r\nhate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over\r\nthe Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast\r\nof his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the\r\npallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous\r\ndive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping\r\na handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw\r\nhimself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,\r\nhe tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the\r\nshivering glass I could hear the \"ting\" of the gold, as some of the\r\nsovereigns fell on the flagging.",
    "We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up\r\nthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.\r\nThere he turned and spoke to us:--",
    "\"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like\r\nsheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think\r\nyou have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is\r\njust begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your\r\ngirls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and\r\nothers shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my\r\njackals when I want to feed. Bah!\" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed\r\nquickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he\r\nfastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us\r\nto speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following\r\nhim through the stable, we moved toward the hall.",
    "\"We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he\r\nfears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His\r\nvery tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You\r\nfollow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For\r\nme, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he\r\nreturn.\" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took\r\nthe title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the\r\nremaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with\r\na match.",
    "Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\r\nlowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,\r\nbolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there\r\nwas no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back\r\nof the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.",
    "It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to\r\nrecognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the\r\nProfessor when he said:--",
    "\"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do\r\njust now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need\r\nnot despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find\r\nit; when that is done all may yet be well.\" I could see that he spoke as\r\nbravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken\r\ndown; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he\r\nwas thinking of his wife.",
    "With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker\r\nwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\r\nbravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as\r\npale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were\r\nin secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--",
    "\"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!\" As she spoke,\r\nshe took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--\"Lay your\r\npoor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect\r\nus if He so will it in His good intent.\" The poor fellow groaned. There\r\nwas no place for words in his sublime misery.",
    "We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us\r\nall up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry\r\npeople--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense\r\nof companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less\r\nmiserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to\r\nour promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and\r\nalthough she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to\r\nthreaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was\r\nmanifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the\r\npart where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to\r\nher husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could\r\nprotect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,\r\ntill the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up\r\nto the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she\r\nstood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the\r\nscene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty\r\nof her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which\r\nshe was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our\r\nteeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against\r\nour grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and\r\nwe, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and\r\npurity and faith, was outcast from God.",
    "\"Jonathan,\" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was\r\nso full of love and tenderness, \"Jonathan dear, and you all my true,\r\ntrue friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this\r\ndreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as\r\nyou destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;\r\nbut it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this\r\nmisery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when\r\nhe, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have\r\nspiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may\r\nnot hold your hands from his destruction.\"",
    "As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as\r\nthough the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.\r\nInstinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his\r\nknuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she\r\nmust have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing\r\nthan ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing\r\nhis hand from hers as he spoke:--",
    "\"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\r\nearthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send\r\nhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\"",
    "\"Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,\r\nJonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just\r\nthink, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that\r\n... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some\r\nother like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,\r\nmy husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought\r\nhad there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured\r\nyour wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and\r\nsorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence\r\nof what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom\r\nso many sorrows have come.\"",
    "We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept\r\nopenly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.\r\nHer husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms\r\nround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned\r\nto us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone\r\nwith their God.",
    "Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\r\nof the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.\r\nShe tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her\r\nhusband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,\r\nI think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at\r\nhand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.\r\nWhen they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should\r\nsit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the\r\npoor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us\r\nshall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,\r\nfor his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go\r\nto bed.",

    "_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.\r\nThere was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief\r\nthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must\r\nnow be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step\r\nwas to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one\r\nearth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he\r\nchooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the\r\nmeantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.\r\nThis I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that\r\none is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her\r\nsweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster\r\nseem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer\r\nby the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting\r\nreefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is\r\nsleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be\r\nlike, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so\r\ncalm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came\r\nover her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.\r\nI thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her\r\nface, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy\r\nmyself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;\r\nfor there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me\r\nuntil....",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was\r\nsitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,\r\nfor we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand\r\nover my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--",
    "\"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!\" I got up softly, and crossing\r\nthe room, gently opened the door.",
    "Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He\r\nraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--",
    "\"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all\r\nnight. We don't mean to take any chances!\"",
    "His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.\r\nShe sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale\r\nface as she put her arms round me and said softly:--",
    "\"Oh, thank God for good brave men!\" With a sigh she sank back again to\r\nsleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by\r\nMina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming\r\ndawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was\r\nlike a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--",
    "\"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.\"",
    "\"Why?\" I asked.",
    "\"I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured\r\nwithout my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I\r\nshall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.\" I\r\nwent to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing\r\nme, he sprang to his feet.",
    "\"Is anything wrong?\" he asked, in alarm.",
    "\"No,\" I replied; \"but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.\"",
    "\"I will go,\" he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.",
    "In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his\r\ndressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at\r\nthe door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a\r\npositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,\r\nwe have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!\" Then\r\nturning to her, he said, cheerfully: \"And what am I do for you? For at\r\nthis hour you do not want me for nothings.\"",
    "\"I want you to hypnotise me!\" she said. \"Do it before the dawn, for I\r\nfeel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is\r\nshort!\" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.",
    "Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,\r\nfrom over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina\r\ngazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat\r\nlike a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually\r\nher eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of\r\nher bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few\r\nmore passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was\r\ncovered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she\r\ndid not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and\r\nher voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to\r\nimpose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.\r\nThey came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the\r\nfoot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The\r\nstillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone\r\nwhich would not break the current of her thoughts:--",
    "\"Where are you?\" The answer came in a neutral way:--",
    "\"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.\" For several\r\nminutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood\r\nstaring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room\r\nwas growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van\r\nHelsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed\r\njust upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse\r\nitself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--",
    "\"Where are you now?\" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it\r\nwere as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the\r\nsame tone when reading her shorthand notes.",
    "\"I do not know. It is all strange to me!\"",
    "\"What do you see?\"",
    "\"I can see nothing; it is all dark.\"",
    "\"What do you hear?\" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient\r\nvoice.",
    "\"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can\r\nhear them on the outside.\"",
    "\"Then you are on a ship?\" We all looked at each other, trying to glean\r\nsomething each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came\r\nquick:--",
    "\"Oh, yes!\"",
    "\"What else do you hear?\"",
    "\"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the\r\ncreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan\r\nfalls into the rachet.\"",
    "\"What are you doing?\"",
    "\"I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!\" The voice faded away into\r\na deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.",
    "By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of\r\nday. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her\r\nhead down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few\r\nmoments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see\r\nus all around her. \"Have I been talking in my sleep?\" was all she said.\r\nShe seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she\r\nwas eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the\r\nconversation, and she said:--",
    "\"Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!\" Mr.\r\nMorris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm\r\nvoice called them back:--",
    "\"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor\r\nwhilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in\r\nyour so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be\r\nthanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we\r\nknow not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,\r\nsince when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking\r\nforward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but\r\nthat sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the\r\nCount's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce\r\nknife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear\r\nme, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men\r\nfollowing like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He\r\nhave take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He\r\nthink to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would\r\nsay when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and\r\nwe must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a\r\nlittle while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters\r\nbetween us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he\r\nwould--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or\r\nslack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to\r\nus. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,\r\nand which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with\r\nus.\" Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--",
    "\"But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?\" He\r\ntook her hand and patted it as he replied:--",
    "\"Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all\r\nquestions.\" He would say no more, and we separated to dress.",
    "After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for\r\na minute and then said sorrowfully:--",
    "\"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him\r\neven if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!\" She grew paler as\r\nshe asked faintly:--",
    "\"Why?\"",
    "\"Because,\" he answered solemnly, \"he can live for centuries, and you are\r\nbut mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark\r\nupon your throat.\"",
    "I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.",

    "This to Jonathan Harker.",
    "You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our\r\nsearch--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we\r\nseek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.\r\nThis is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him\r\nhere. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,\r\nfor I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back\r\nto his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of\r\nfire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and\r\nthat last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the\r\nmoney; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun\r\ngo down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that\r\nhe think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.\r\nBut there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last\r\nresource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.\r\nHe is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and\r\nso he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,\r\nand he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;\r\nwhen we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will\r\ncomfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope\r\nwhen you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we\r\npursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in\r\none day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is\r\nfinite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.\r\nBut we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong\r\ntogether. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is\r\nbut begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high\r\nto watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.",

    "_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in the\r\nphonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the\r\ncertainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;\r\nand comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible\r\ndanger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to\r\nbelieve in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem\r\nlike a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright\r\nsunlight----",
    "Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on\r\nthe red scar on my poor darling's white forehead. Whilst that lasts,\r\nthere can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will\r\nkeep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been\r\nover all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality\r\nseems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is\r\nsomething of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.\r\nMina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may\r\nbe! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other\r\nyet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and\r\nthe others after their investigations.",

    "Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to\r\ndiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--",
    "\"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that\r\nhe must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since\r\nby that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne\r\nignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what\r\nships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since\r\nMadam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in\r\nyour list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of\r\nLord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,\r\nhowever so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go\r\nout with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from\r\nDoolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the\r\nDanube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off\r\nwe go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood\r\nso small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire\r\nof the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face\r\nand loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey\r\ngive him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and\r\nput it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he\r\nstill better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask\r\nmany men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they\r\nhave been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of\r\nothers which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but\r\nnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.",
    "\"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five\r\no'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose\r\nand teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in\r\nblack, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the\r\ntime. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship\r\nsails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and\r\nthen to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of\r\ngang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when\r\ntold that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he\r\nagree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse\r\nand cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself\r\ndriving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it\r\ntake several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to\r\ncaptain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like\r\nit not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he\r\ncan come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come not\r\nyet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he\r\nhad better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the\r\nplace--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin\r\nman smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he\r\nwill be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,\r\npolyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he\r\nwill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the\r\nsailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell\r\nhim that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also\r\nwith blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking\r\nwhere there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship\r\nforms, he departed.",
    "\"No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for\r\nthey had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon\r\nbecame apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as\r\nwas expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,\r\nand grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.\r\nThe captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and\r\nblood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to\r\nfear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,\r\nwhen just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and\r\nasked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied\r\nthat he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and\r\nblood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down\r\nwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile\r\non deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.\r\nIndeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and\r\nall was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was\r\nof bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears\r\nexceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of\r\npicturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up\r\nand down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any\r\nof fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship\r\nwent out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the\r\nriver mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.",
    "\"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for\r\nour enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the\r\nDanube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when\r\nwe start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope\r\nis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then\r\nhe can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There\r\nare days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about\r\nwhere he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us\r\ninvoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in\r\nVarna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present\r\nhis credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.\r\nWhen he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and\r\nhave inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not\r\nfor police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own\r\nway.\"",
    "When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain\r\nthat the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: \"We have the\r\nbest proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this\r\nmorning.\" I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should\r\npursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that\r\nhe would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,\r\nat first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more\r\nforceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some\r\nof that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst\r\nmen:--",
    "\"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,\r\nand then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm\r\nalready, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short\r\ntime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in\r\ndarkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my\r\ndear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or\r\nin that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his\r\nown barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life\r\nof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the\r\nwork of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do\r\nwhat he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have\r\nbeen, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of\r\nnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in\r\nsome wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for\r\nall these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical\r\nworld. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.\r\nThere have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters\r\nof strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,\r\nthere is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of\r\noccult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in\r\nhimself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike\r\ntime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,\r\nmore braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in\r\nstrange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and\r\nthrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which\r\nis surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,\r\nand are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have\r\ninfect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for\r\ngood of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do\r\nno more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and\r\nso in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,\r\nshall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together\r\nthat it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the\r\nworld, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,\r\nwhose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one\r\nsoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem\r\nmore. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if\r\nwe fall, we fall in good cause.\" He paused and I said:--",
    "\"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven\r\nfrom England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from\r\nwhich he has been hunted?\"",
    "\"Aha!\" he said, \"your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\r\nadopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once\r\ntasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl\r\nunceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a\r\ntiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he\r\nis not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go\r\nover the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be\r\nbeaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.\r\nLook at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to\r\nhim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What\r\ndoes he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for\r\nhim. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He\r\nfind in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He\r\nstudy new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old\r\nways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new\r\nland and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that\r\nhe have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help\r\nhim to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at\r\nthe first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a\r\nruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater\r\nworld of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know\r\nhim; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole\r\npeoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,\r\nwhat a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we\r\nare pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our\r\nefforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not\r\neven what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest\r\nstrength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons\r\nto destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls\r\nfor the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the\r\nhonour and glory of God.\"",

    "_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for\r\neach and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more\r\ngeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience\r\nagain.",
    "It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let\r\nany obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by\r\ndeath--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More\r\nthan once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether\r\nthe whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I\r\ncaught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was\r\nbrought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the\r\nmatter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our\r\ntrouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her\r\ntrouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something\r\nrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to\r\nmeet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of\r\naction. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct\r\nrather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear\r\nthat in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_\r\nthat she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can\r\nguess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or\r\ncannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and\r\nhe and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of\r\nthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The\r\nCount had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \"the\r\nVampire's baptism of blood.\" Well, there may be a poison that distils\r\nitself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is\r\na mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my\r\ninstinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a\r\nterrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same\r\npower that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think\r\nfurther; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!",
    "Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall\r\ntry to open the subject with him.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\r\nthings. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to\r\nsay, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating\r\nabout the bush a little, he said suddenly:--",
    "\"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just\r\nat the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our\r\nconfidence\"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--",
    "\"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\" A cold shiver ran\r\nthrough me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing\r\ncontinued:--",
    "\"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\r\nbefore things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than\r\never, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I\r\ncan see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now\r\nbut very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice\r\nwithout to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes\r\nare more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now\r\noften; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she\r\nwrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If\r\nit be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and\r\nhear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who\r\nhave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he\r\nwill, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?\" I nodded\r\nacquiescence; he went on:--",
    "\"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of\r\nour intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful\r\ntask! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.\r\nWhen to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not\r\nto speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\r\nus.\" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration\r\nat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\r\nsoul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort\r\nto him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at\r\nany rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the\r\neffect was as I expected.",
    "It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has\r\ngone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I\r\nreally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was\r\nexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a\r\nmessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as\r\nshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements\r\nwithout her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each\r\nother for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own\r\npart, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was\r\nmuch pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we\r\nagreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to\r\npreserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to\r\nconfer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van\r\nHelsing roughly put the facts before us first:--",
    "\"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take\r\nher at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to\r\nreach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.\r\nNow, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such\r\nweather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if\r\nwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,\r\nthen we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite\r\nsafe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate\r\nbe in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such\r\npreparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed\r\nagainst evil things, spiritual as well as physical.\" Here Quincey Morris\r\nadded:--",
    "\"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be\r\nthat he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to\r\nour armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any\r\ntrouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack\r\nafter us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater\r\napiece!\"",
    "\"Good!\" said Van Helsing, \"Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is\r\nlevel at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more\r\ndishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we\r\ncan do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of\r\nus, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.\r\nTo-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we\r\nfour can set out on our journey.\"",
    "\"We four?\" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\r\nus.",
    "\"Of course!\" answered the Professor quickly, \"you must remain to take\r\ncare of your so sweet wife!\" Harker was silent for awhile and then said\r\nin a hollow voice:--",
    "\"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with\r\nMina.\" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not\r\nto disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him\r\nsignificantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and\r\nturned away.",
    "_Jonathan Harker's Journal._",
    "_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I\r\ncould not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\r\nwonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not\r\nto take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not\r\nargue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from\r\na solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the\r\nlast time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no\r\nmore concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly\r\nand sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams\r\nwith happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and\r\ncame as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the\r\nevening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking\r\nlower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at\r\nonce Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--",
    "\"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A\r\npromise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be\r\nbroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\r\ntears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.\"",
    "\"Mina,\" I said, \"a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have\r\nno right to make it.\"",
    "\"But, dear one,\" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes\r\nwere like pole stars, \"it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.\r\nYou can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may\r\ndo as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved\r\nfrom the promise.\"",
    "\"I promise!\" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though\r\nto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.\r\nShe said:--",
    "\"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for\r\nthe campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or\r\nimplication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!\" and she\r\nsolemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said\r\nsolemnly:--",
    "\"I promise!\" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had\r\nbeen shut between us.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.\r\nSo much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected\r\nsomewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall\r\nof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired\r\nearly. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing\r\nthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible\r\ntrouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.\r\nPerhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall\r\ntry it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the\r\nsame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought\r\nthat it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went\r\nfor the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found\r\nhim dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the\r\nopening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the\r\nroom, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.",
    "\"No,\" she said quite simply, \"it will not be necessary. You can tell\r\nthem just as well. I must go with you on your journey.\"",
    "Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause he\r\nasked:--",
    "\"But why?\"",
    "\"You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,\r\ntoo.\"",
    "\"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest\r\nduty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than\r\nany of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.\" He paused,\r\nembarrassed.",
    "As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--",
    "\"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is\r\ncoming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me\r\nI must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by\r\nwile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.\" God saw the look that\r\nshe turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel\r\nthat look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her\r\nhand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of\r\ntears. She went on:--",
    "\"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you\r\ncan defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had\r\nto guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me\r\nand so learn that which even I myself do not know.\" Dr. Van Helsing said\r\nvery gravely:--",
    "\"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and\r\ntogether we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.\" When he had\r\nspoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen\r\nback on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up\r\nthe blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing\r\nmotioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within\r\na minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.\r\nHe told them what Mina had said, and went on:--",
    "\"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a\r\nnew factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony\r\nto tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are\r\nwarned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be\r\nready to act the instant when that ship arrives.\"",
    "\"What shall we do exactly?\" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor\r\npaused before replying:--",
    "\"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified\r\nthe box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall\r\nfasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the\r\nsuperstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was\r\nman's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,\r\nwhen we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we\r\nshall open the box, and--and all will be well.\"",
    "\"I shall not wait for any opportunity,\" said Morris. \"When I see the box\r\nI shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand\r\nmen looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!\" I\r\ngrasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.\r\nI think he understood my look; I hope he did.",
    "\"Good boy,\" said Dr. Van Helsing. \"Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God\r\nbless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or\r\npause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,\r\nindeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things\r\nwhich may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that\r\nuntil the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and\r\nwhen the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now\r\nlet us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch\r\non others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us\r\ncan tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own\r\naffairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make\r\narrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for\r\nour journey.\"",
    "There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle\r\nup all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she\r\nsurvive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who\r\nhave been so good to us shall have remainder.",
    "It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina's uneasiness calls my\r\nattention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the\r\ntime of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing\r\ntimes for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new\r\ndanger--some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a\r\ngood end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must\r\nnot hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they\r\nshall be ready.",

    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY",
    "_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he\r\nsays he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.",
    "I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.\r\nHarker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to\r\nunderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;\r\nwhen her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing\r\nor restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition\r\nbegins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts\r\ntill either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with\r\nthe rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of\r\nnegative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute\r\nfreedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the\r\nchange-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of\r\nwarning silence.",
    "To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the\r\nsigns of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a\r\nviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few\r\nminutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning\r\nher husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,\r\nshe made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand\r\nin hers began:--",
    "\"We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,\r\ndear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.\" This was to\r\nher husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. \"In\r\nthe morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in\r\nstore for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me\r\nwith you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak\r\nwoman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate\r\nat stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.\r\nThere is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which\r\nmust destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you\r\nknow as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there\r\nis one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!\" She looked\r\nappealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.",
    "\"What is that way?\" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. \"What is that\r\nway, which we must not--may not--take?\"",
    "\"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before\r\nthe greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I\r\nonce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you\r\ndid my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing\r\nthat stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the\r\nfriends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die\r\nin such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be\r\ndone, is God's will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the\r\ncertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the\r\nblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!\" We were all\r\nsilent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The\r\nfaces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he\r\nguessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--",
    "\"This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.\" I could not but note the\r\nquaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all\r\nseriousness. \"What will each of you give? Your lives I know,\" she went\r\non quickly, \"that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's, and you\r\ncan give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?\" She looked\r\nagain questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quincey\r\nseemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. \"Then I shall tell\r\nyou plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this\r\nconnection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,\r\nmy beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.\"",
    "\"What is that time?\" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and\r\nstrained.",
    "\"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that\r\nI die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;\r\nor do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!\"",
    "Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her\r\nand taking her hand in his said solemnly:--",
    "\"I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to\r\nwin such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and\r\ndear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty\r\nthat you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all\r\ncertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has\r\ncome!\"",
    "\"My true friend!\" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,\r\nbending over, she kissed his hand.",
    "\"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\" said Van Helsing.",
    "\"And I!\" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to\r\ntake the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her\r\nwan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of\r\nhis hair, and asked:--",
    "\"And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?\"",
    "\"You too, my dearest,\" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her\r\nvoice and eyes. \"You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and\r\nall the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all\r\ntime. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed\r\ntheir wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because\r\nthose that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's duty\r\ntowards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my\r\ndear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at\r\nthe hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not\r\nforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved\"--she stopped\r\nwith a flying blush, and changed her phrase--\"to him who had best right\r\nto give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make\r\nit a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which\r\nset me free from the awful thrall upon me.\"",
    "\"Again I swear!\" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harker\r\nsmiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and\r\nsaid:--",
    "\"And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:\r\nthis time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in\r\nsuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a\r\ntime I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued\r\nwith your enemy against you.\"",
    "\"One more request;\" she became very solemn as she said this, \"it is not\r\nvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for\r\nme, if you will.\" We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need\r\nto speak:--",
    "\"I want you to read the Burial Service.\" She was interrupted by a deep\r\ngroan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her\r\nheart, and continued: \"You must read it over me some day. Whatever may\r\nbe the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet\r\nthought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for\r\nthen it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!\"",
    "\"But oh, my dear one,\" he pleaded, \"death is afar off from you.\"",
    "\"Nay,\" she said, holding up a warning hand. \"I am deeper in death at\r\nthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!\"",
    "\"Oh, my wife, must I read it?\" he said, before he began.",
    "\"It would comfort me, my husband!\" was all she said; and he began to\r\nread when she had got the book ready.",
    "\"How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its\r\nsolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its\r\nsweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter\r\ntruth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart\r\nhad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling\r\nround that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of\r\nher husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he\r\nhad to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial\r\nof the Dead.

    "She was right in her instinct.

Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into\r\nport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.\r\nThank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is\r\ncoming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept\r\nnearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very\r\nwakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to\r\nhypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he\r\nhad to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by\r\nhabit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at\r\nthese particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He\r\nalways asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--",
    "\"Nothing; all is dark.\" And to the second:--",
    "\"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing\r\nby. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is\r\nhigh--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.\"\r\nIt is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on\r\nher way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four\r\ntelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:\r\nthat the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from\r\nanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should\r\nsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He\r\nwas to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be\r\nsure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.",
    "We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the\r\nVice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship\r\nas soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get\r\non the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the\r\nform of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and\r\nso cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form without\r\nsuspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the\r\nbox. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;\r\nfor we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,\r\nbefore he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for\r\nmuch. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the\r\nseamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,\r\nand we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the\r\nship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being\r\nwarned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I\r\nthink!",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_16 October._--Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushing\r\nwater, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and\r\nwhen we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must\r\npass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome\r\nthe Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that\r\nhe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from\r\na friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own\r\nrisk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every\r\nfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a\r\nsimilar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who\r\nwas much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all\r\nsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We\r\nhave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the\r\nCount is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and\r\ndrive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall\r\nprevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall\r\nhave ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,\r\nit will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no\r\nevidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But\r\neven if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps\r\nsome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and\r\na rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it\r\nwere to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our\r\nintent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the\r\n_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special\r\nmessenger.",

    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is\r\nirksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with\r\nexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I\r\nknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.\r\nHarker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After\r\nall, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to\r\nlet her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any\r\nexcitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am\r\nsure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but\r\nin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The\r\nlethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is\r\ngetting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We\r\ntalk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It\r\nwould break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we\r\nhad even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,\r\nher teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for\r\nhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active\r\ndanger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be\r\nnecessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to\r\nbe, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should\r\nneither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.\r\n\"Euthanasia\" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to\r\nwhoever invented it.",
    "It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the\r\nrate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore\r\narrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in\r\nbefore then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one\r\no'clock, so as to be ready.",

    "_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs. Harker's\r\nhypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible\r\nthat we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of\r\nexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and\r\nan hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife\r\nwhich he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the\r\nCount if the edge of that \"Kukri\" ever touches his throat, driven by\r\nthat stern, ice-cold hand!",
    "Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About\r\nnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we\r\nkept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She\r\nhad been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know\r\nthat she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually\r\nthat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to\r\nher room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so\r\nwell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than\r\nanything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder\r\nthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.",

That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is\r\napparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the\r\nsame. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;\r\nsome of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog\r\nboth to north and south of the port.

He added significantly:--",
    "\"I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can do\r\nstrange things during trance.\" I was about to ask him more, but Harker\r\njust then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night\r\nat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.",

    "\"_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o'clock\r\n     to-day.\"",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I\r\ndo not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been\r\nexpected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would\r\ncome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.\r\nThe delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things\r\nwould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the\r\nchange would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose\r\nthat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against\r\nourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know\r\nthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if\r\nit be a will-o'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all\r\ntook it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a\r\nmoment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a\r\nword, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord\r\nGodalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half\r\nstunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris\r\ntightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our\r\nold wandering days it meant \"action.\" Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so\r\nthat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands\r\nmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the\r\ndark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his\r\naction belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of\r\nthe great Kukri knife and rested there. \"When does the next train start\r\nfor Galatz?\" said Van Helsing to us generally.",
    "\"At 6:30 to-morrow morning!\" We all started, for the answer came from\r\nMrs. Harker.",
    "\"How on earth do you know?\" said Art.",
    "\"You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\r\ndoes Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I\r\nalways used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my\r\nhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\r\nthe time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\r\nDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\r\nlearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,\r\nas the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\"",
    "\"Wonderful woman!\" murmured the Professor.",
    "\"Can't we get a special?\" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his\r\nhead: \"I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even\r\nif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\r\nregular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.\r\nNow let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\r\ntickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do\r\nyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\r\nletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\r\njust as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\r\nhis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\r\nsmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay\r\nwith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you\r\nmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\r\nwith Madam to make report.\"",
    "\"And I,\" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\r\nhad been for many a long day, \"shall try to be of use in all ways, and\r\nshall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting\r\nfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\"\r\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\r\nrealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\r\neach other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the\r\ntime, however.",
    "When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\r\nHarker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\r\nHarker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door\r\nwas shut upon her he said to me:--",
    "\"We mean the same! speak out!\"",
    "\"There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\r\ndeceive us.\"",
    "\"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\"",
    "\"No!\" said I, \"unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\"",
    "\"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell\r\nyou something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;\r\nbut I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those\r\nwords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In\r\nthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\r\nmind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\r\nwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn\r\nthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\r\neyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.\r\nNow he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.",
    "\"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\r\nbut he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\r\nso she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that\r\nhave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\r\ncome higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,\r\nthat grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and\r\ntherefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!\r\nShe know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when\r\nwe want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great\r\nbrain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have\r\na special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\r\naltogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall\r\nlearn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never\r\nfeared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!\"",
    "I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\r\njust as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\r\nhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into\r\nthe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\r\nforgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\r\nof typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face\r\nbrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and\r\nthumb he said:--",
    "\"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,\r\ndear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\r\nthink. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\r\nlet him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\r\nwhere that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought\r\nat all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\r\nstrong to use his little wings. Nay, like the \"Ugly Duck\" of my friend\r\nHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\r\nsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I\r\nread here what Jonathan have written:--",
    "\"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\r\nhis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\r\nbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\r\nalone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\r\nsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\"",
    "\"What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child-thought see\r\nnothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my\r\nman-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word\r\nfrom some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what\r\nit mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,\r\nyet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--then\r\npouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill\r\nand destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and\r\nleagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever\r\nstudy the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it is\r\na study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not\r\nbut once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad\r\nuniversale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,\r\nin all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much\r\nfrom philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to\r\nbe empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true\r\ncriminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.\r\nThis criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and\r\nresourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of\r\nchild-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime\r\nalso; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he\r\nhave done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not\r\nby principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to\r\nhim the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' said\r\nArchimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,\r\nis the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have\r\nthe purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,\r\njust as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are\r\nopened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,\" for\r\nMrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--",
    "\"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\r\nthose so bright eyes.\" He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.\r\nHis finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\r\nunconsciously, as she spoke:--",
    "\"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would\r\nso classify him, and _qu\u00e2_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.\r\nThus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a\r\nclue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own\r\nlips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a\r\n'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had\r\ntried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\r\nfor a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.\r\nSo he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all\r\nhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\r\nthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\r\nfrom Turkey Land.\"",
    "\"Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!\" said Van Helsing,\r\nenthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he\r\nsaid to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room\r\nconsultation:--",
    "\"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.\" Turning to\r\nher again, he said with keen expectation:--",
    "\"But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;\r\nJohn and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.\r\nSpeak, without fear!\"",
    "\"I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\"",
    "\"Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\"",
    "\"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\r\nand his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\r\npurpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,\r\nleaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\r\nsafe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat\r\nfrom the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful\r\nnight. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul\r\nis freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me\r\nis a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for\r\nhis ends.\" The Professor stood up:--",
    "\"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\r\nwhilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\r\nGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.\r\nBut his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in\r\nGod's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for\r\nhis selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken\r\nin his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he\r\nis free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so\r\nmany hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to\r\nsleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,\r\nthere can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That\r\nterrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him\r\nin spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the\r\nsun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;\r\nand this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your\r\nsuffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know\r\nit not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his\r\nknowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe\r\nthat God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark\r\nhours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril\r\nourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great\r\nhour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe\r\nand write him all down, so that when the others return from their work\r\nyou can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.\"",

    "DR. SEWARD'S DIARY",
    "_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last\r\nnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us\r\nhad done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,\r\nand opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and\r\nfor our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.\r\nHarker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\r\nmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\r\nnecessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but\r\nthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\r\nresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--",
    "\"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a\r\nsteady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear\r\nmen's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\r\nthe rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.\r\nThere is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged\r\nalong. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\r\nblowing upon me.\"",
    "Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\r\non the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a\r\nweight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.\r\nQuincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\r\nHarker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There\r\nwas a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was\r\npassing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she\r\nsat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--",
    "\"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\" We\r\ncould only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get\r\ntea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--",
    "\"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his\r\nearth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie\r\nhidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do\r\nnot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be\r\nin the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did\r\nat Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he\r\nbe carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men\r\nmay discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on\r\nshore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.\r\nWe may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come\r\non him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his\r\ntrue self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.\"",
    "There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;\r\nat which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.",
    "Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\r\nresponse in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\r\nthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was\r\nso short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole\r\nsoul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\r\nreply:--",
    "\"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\r\nof wood on wood.\" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till\r\nto-night.",
    "And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\r\nexpectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;\r\nbut already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot\r\npossibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more\r\nhypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw\r\nmore light on what is happening.",
    "*       *       *       *       *",
    "_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when\r\nthere was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a\r\nstation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\r\nMrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\r\nthis morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's\r\nsensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that\r\nher imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance\r\nhitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes\r\non it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power\r\nover her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be\r\na happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did\r\nspeak, her words were enigmatical:--",
    "\"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can\r\nhear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,\r\nfierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.\" She stopped and a\r\nshudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,\r\ntill, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even\r\nin answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from\r\nthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was\r\nall alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;\r\nwhen she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\r\nsilence.",

    "_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time\r\nto write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.\r\nKnowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\r\nVan Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no\r\neffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\r\ngreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor\r\nlost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--",
    "\"All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the\r\ncreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a\r\nqueer one like----\" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.",
    "\"Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!\" said Van Helsing in an agonised\r\nvoice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun\r\nwas reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face. She opened her eyes, and we\r\nall started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost\r\nunconcern:--",
    "\"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't remember\r\nanything.\" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,\r\nturning from one to the other with a troubled look:--",
    "\"What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was\r\nlying here, half asleep, and heard you say 'go on! speak, I command you!'\r\nIt seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad\r\nchild!\"",
    "\"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, sadly, \"it is proof, if proof be needed, of\r\nhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more\r\nearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I\r\nam proud to obey!\"",

    "_30 October._--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called\r\non Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of\r\nHapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord\r\nGodalming's telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in\r\ntheir power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once\r\non board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river\r\nharbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his\r\nvoyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a\r\nrun.",
    "\"Man!\" he said, \"but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should\r\nhave to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the\r\naverage. It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind\r\nahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his\r\nain purpose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh\r\na ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us,\r\ntill when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could\r\nwe see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we\r\ncame to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we\r\nnever were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail\r\nand beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the\r\nDeil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it\r\nwhether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our\r\nmiscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who\r\nhad served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no\r\nhinderin' him.\" This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition\r\nand commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--",
    "\"Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and\r\nhe know when he meet his match!\" The skipper was not displeased with the\r\ncompliment, and went on:--",
    "\"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,\r\nthe Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had\r\nbeen put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started\r\nfrae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa\r\nfingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the\r\nsupersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot\r\ntheir business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I\r\nfelt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was\r\nagin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for\r\nfive days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get\r\nsomewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well,\r\nwe'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and\r\ndeep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came\r\nthrough the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.\r\nThe Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the\r\nbox and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a\r\nhandspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in\r\nhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the\r\nproperty and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the\r\nriver Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to\r\nfling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it\r\nlie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We\r\ndidn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;\r\nbut in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came\r\naboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box\r\nmarked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to\r\nhis hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the\r\ndam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil\r\ndid have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither\r\nthan that same!\"",
    "\"What was the name of the man who took it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing with\r\nrestrained eagerness.",
    "\"I'll be tellin' ye quick!\" he answered, and, stepping down to his\r\ncabin, produced a receipt signed \"Immanuel Hildesheim.\" Burgen-strasse\r\n16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so\r\nwith thanks we came away.",
    "We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi\r\nTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were\r\npointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little\r\nbargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but\r\nimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling\r\nhim to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box\r\nwhich would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to\r\ngive in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks\r\nwho traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by\r\nan English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube\r\nInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to\r\nthe ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all\r\nhe knew.",
    "We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his\r\nneighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had\r\ngone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by\r\nhis landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house\r\ntogether with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten\r\nand eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.",
    "Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that\r\nthe body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of\r\nSt. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild\r\nanimal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the\r\nwomen crying out \"This is the work of a Slovak!\" We hurried away lest we\r\nshould have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.",
    "As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all\r\nconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where\r\nthat might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home\r\nto the hotel to Mina.",
    "When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina\r\nagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at\r\nleast a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was\r\nreleased from my promise to her.",

    "(Entered in her Journal.)",
    "_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own\r\nplace.",
    "(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he\r\npower to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,\r\nor bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or\r\ninterference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined\r\nas he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.",
    "(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help\r\nus. By road, by rail, by water?",
    "1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the\r\ncity.",
    "(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,\r\na surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.",
    "(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.",
    "(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order\r\nto prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even\r\nhis victim--me!",
    "2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to\r\ntake its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies\r\non the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if\r\nleft in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not\r\nwhat he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.",
    "3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most\r\ndanger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even\r\nthen he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were\r\nhe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would\r\nindeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were\r\nunfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would\r\nstill be desperate.",
    "We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do\r\nis to ascertain _what_ water.",
    "The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,\r\nthen, get a light on what his later task is to be.",
    "_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part\r\nof his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had\r\nto arrange as best he could.",
    "_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we\r\nknow of, what he has done here.",
    "As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent\r\ninvoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of\r\nexit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.\r\nThe proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel\r\nHildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is\r\nalso the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but\r\nthere must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to\r\nHildesheim.",
    "That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_\r\nmade a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's\r\nsuspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness\r\nplayed the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind\r\nthrough fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the\r\nCount's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared\r\nthe box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here\r\nwe lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,\r\nmoving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been\r\navoided.",
    "Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on\r\nland_, at Galatz.",
    "The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could\r\nappear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to\r\naid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing\r\nwith the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's\r\nremark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general\r\nfeeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.",
    "My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his\r\ncastle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from\r\nthe castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks\r\nwho took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.\r\nThus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this\r\nservice. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he\r\ncame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to\r\narranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and\r\nhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,\r\nby murdering his agent.",
    "I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the\r\nSlovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in\r\nthe typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling\r\nlevel with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,\r\nwas on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or\r\npoles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There\r\nwould be no such sound if floating down stream.",
    "Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may\r\npossibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more\r\neasily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza\r\nwhich runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as\r\nclose to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.",
    "_Mina Harker's Journal--continued._",
    "When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The\r\nothers kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--",
    "\"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where\r\nwe were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we\r\nmay succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on\r\nhim by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he\r\nis powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry\r\nhim may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw\r\nhim in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,\r\nto our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all\r\nshall do.\"",
    "\"I shall get a steam launch and follow him,\" said Lord Godalming.",
    "\"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,\" said Mr.\r\nMorris.",
    "\"Good!\" said the Professor, \"both good. But neither must go alone. There\r\nmust be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and\r\nrough, and he carries rude arms.\" All the men smiled, for amongst them\r\nthey carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--",
    "\"I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and\r\nthere may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other\r\nprecautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could\r\nnot quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.\" Dr.\r\nSeward said:--",
    "\"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt\r\ntogether, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come\r\nalong. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the\r\nSlovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry\r\nguns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we\r\nshall not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and\r\nwe are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.\" He looked at Jonathan as he\r\nspoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was\r\ntorn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the\r\nboat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...\r\nthe ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was\r\nsilent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--",
    "\"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you\r\nare young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the\r\nlast; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has\r\nwrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she\r\nwill be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as\r\nonce; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to\r\nfight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in\r\nother way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let\r\nme say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and\r\nfriend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and\r\nwhilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be\r\nlanded, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's\r\ncountry. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running\r\nstream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid\r\nof his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to\r\nperish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz\r\nover the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam\r\nMina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all\r\ndark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near\r\nthat fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be\r\nmade sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.\" Here\r\nJonathan interrupted him hotly:--",
    "\"Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,\r\nin her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right\r\ninto the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or\r\nHell!\" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--",
    "\"Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish\r\ninfamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every\r\nspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?\r\nHave you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?\" Here he turned to\r\nme, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:\r\n\"Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!\" and he sank\r\ndown on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he\r\nspoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed\r\nus all:--",
    "\"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful\r\nplace that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that\r\nplace. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not\r\nsee. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what\r\nis to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in\r\nterrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and\r\nsubtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then\r\nin time our dear one\"--he took my hand--\"would come to him to keep him\r\ncompany, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have\r\ntold us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they\r\nclutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and\r\nwell may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is\r\nnecessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,\r\npossibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,\r\nit is I who would have to go to keep them company.\"",
    "\"Do as you will,\" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, \"we\r\nare in the hands of God!\"",

And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!\r\nWhat can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do\r\nwhen basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and\r\nthat both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing\r\nto spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could\r\nnot start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within\r\nanother hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each\r\nof us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam\r\nlaunch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr. Seward\r\nand Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have\r\nall the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor\r\nVan Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,\r\nwhere we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are\r\nbringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and\r\nhorses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust\r\nin the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,\r\nso we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a\r\nlarge-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like\r\nthe rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my\r\nforehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me\r\nthat I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting\r\ncolder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as\r\nwarnings.",

    "_Jonathan Harker's Journal._",
    "_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace\r\ndoor of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an\r\nexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his\r\nown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our\r\nplans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any\r\nwaterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the\r\nSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took\r\nit, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the\r\nplace chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the\r\nCarpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at\r\nnight; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to\r\nmake steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to\r\nsleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on\r\nwatch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging\r\nover my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only\r\ncomfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would\r\nbe easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.\r\nMorris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;\r\nthey are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher\r\nlands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following\r\nof its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead\r\ntheir spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When\r\nthey dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look\r\nafter the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they\r\ncan mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and\r\ncan be easily adapted for Mina, if required.",
    "It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through\r\nthe darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike\r\nus; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes\r\nhome. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into\r\na whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the\r\nfurnace door....",

As yet we have passed only\r\na few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of\r\nanything like the size of the one we seek.

We have over-hauled every boat, big\r\nand little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,\r\nand treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,\r\nso at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a\r\nRoumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we\r\nhave over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every\r\ndeference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose\r\nto ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,\r\ngoing at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This\r\nwas before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the\r\nboat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu\r\nwe could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the\r\nnight. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell\r\nupon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he\r\nshall keep the first watch.

It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept\r\nso long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new\r\nman this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do\r\nall that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and\r\nkeeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to\r\nme. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to\r\nVeresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the\r\ncarriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they\r\nwould be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am\r\nafraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we\r\ncannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how\r\nDr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless\r\nstreams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them\r\nare very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible\r\ndoubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have\r\nmet much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see\r\nthem; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be\r\nnecessary to take counsel together what to do next.",

Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and\r\nevidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got\r\nup the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase\r\nafresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the\r\npeasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept\r\nstopping every now and again so long as she was in sight.

    "_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The\r\nhorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go\r\nwillingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many\r\nchanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to\r\nthink that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;\r\nhe tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well\r\nto make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and\r\noff we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable\r\nkinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full\r\nof nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first\r\nhouse where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my\r\nforehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to\r\nkeep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an\r\nextra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever\r\nsince then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have\r\nescaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no\r\ndriver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay\r\nthat fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The\r\nProfessor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he\r\nmade me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he\r\nsays that I answered as usual \"darkness, lapping water and creaking\r\nwood\"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of\r\nJonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write\r\nthis whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.\r\nVan Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and\r\ngrey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep\r\nhe is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make\r\nhim rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,\r\nand we must not break down when most of all his strength will be\r\nneeded....

At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered\r\n\"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,\" so the river is changing as\r\nthey ascend.

We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an\r\neffort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.\r\nVan Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The\r\nhouses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse\r\nwe got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He\r\ngot two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude\r\nfour-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no\r\ntrouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can\r\ndrive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive\r\nbefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn.

    "_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._",
    "_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of\r\nPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is\r\nmorning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept\r\nalive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey\r\nheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all\r\nwinter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have\r\naffected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was\r\nnot like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual\r\nso alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost\r\nher appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so\r\nfaithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.\r\nHowever, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh\r\nand restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset\r\nI try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown\r\nless and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,\r\nGod's will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!",
    "Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I\r\nmust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go\r\nunrecorded.",
    "We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I\r\nsaw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our\r\ncarriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a\r\ncouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but\r\nmore slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As\r\nbefore, came the answer: \"darkness and the swirling of water.\" Then she\r\nwoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.\r\nAt this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new\r\nguiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--",
    "\"This is the way.\"",
    "\"How know you it?\" I ask.",
    "\"Of course I know it,\" she answer, and with a pause, add: \"Have not my\r\nJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?\"",
    "At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one\r\nsuch by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach\r\nroad from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and\r\nmore of use.",
    "So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we\r\nsure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow\r\nhave fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and\r\nthey go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan\r\nhave note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long\r\nhours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and\r\nshe succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to\r\nsuspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may\r\nnot wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm\r\nher; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be\r\nall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel\r\nguilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the\r\nreins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I\r\nlook down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset\r\ntime, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,\r\nso that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.\r\nFor we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though\r\nit were the end of the world.",
    "Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and\r\nthen I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as\r\nthough I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and\r\nmyself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.\r\nMadam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,\r\nand look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we\r\nfirst enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she\r\nis so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I\r\nlight a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she\r\nprepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,\r\nto feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go\r\nto help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that\r\nshe was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have\r\ngrave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She\r\nhelp me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the\r\nfire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all\r\nof watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying\r\nquiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice\r\nmore the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I\r\nwake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes\r\nobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then\r\nsleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have\r\nto lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have\r\nharnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look\r\nin her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it\r\nnot. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even\r\nto think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and\r\ndeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.",

    "All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and\r\nmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,\r\nfrowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held\r\nsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I\r\ndid have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I\r\nbegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as\r\nshe is with that Vampire baptism. \"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if it be\r\nthat she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at\r\nnight.\" As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and\r\nimperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked\r\nwith a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still\r\nsleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning\r\nmountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a\r\nsteep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell\r\nof in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,\r\nthe end was near.",
    "I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!\r\nunavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for\r\neven after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and\r\nall was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed\r\nthem in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make\r\nMadam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid\r\nher rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that\r\nshe had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But\r\nI myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the\r\nfear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round\r\nwhere Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and\r\nI broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the\r\ntime--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the\r\nsnow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she\r\nclung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to\r\nfeet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when\r\nshe had grown more quiet:--",
    "\"Will you not come over to the fire?\" for I wished to make a test of\r\nwhat she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she\r\nstopped, and stood as one stricken.",
    "\"Why not go on?\" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat\r\ndown in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked\r\nfrom sleep, she said simply:--",
    "\"I cannot!\" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she\r\ncould not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be\r\ndanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!",
    "Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I\r\ncame to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they\r\nwhinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a\r\ntime. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to\r\nthe cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was\r\nwith quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was\r\nabout stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying\r\nsweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of\r\nsome kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the\r\nsnow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with\r\ntrailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses\r\nwhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to\r\nfear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that\r\nring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of\r\nthe night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and\r\nall the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's\r\nhorrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist\r\nbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy\r\nglimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses\r\ncowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even\r\nthe madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I\r\nfeared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and\r\ncircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when\r\nI would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held\r\nme back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low\r\nit was:--",
    "\"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!\" I turned to her, and\r\nlooking in her eyes, said:--",
    "\"But you? It is for you that I fear!\" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low\r\nand unreal, and said:--",
    "\"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them\r\nthan I am,\" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of\r\nwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.\r\nThen, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the\r\nwheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without\r\nthe Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not\r\ntake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me\r\nin actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when\r\nthey would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the\r\nbright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\r\nlips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came\r\nthrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to\r\nher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were\r\nof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--",
    "\"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!\" In fear I turned to my poor\r\nMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the\r\nterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my\r\nheart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I\r\nseized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the\r\nWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and\r\nlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for\r\nI knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not\r\napproach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within\r\nthe ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The\r\nhorses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on\r\nthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor\r\nbeasts no more of terror.",
    "And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the\r\nsnow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but\r\nwhen that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.\r\nAt the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the\r\nwhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away\r\ntowards the castle, and were lost.",
    "Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending\r\nto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I\r\ncould not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made\r\nno response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have\r\nmade my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have\r\nmuch to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there\r\nmay be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist\r\nobscure it, will be to me a safety.",
    "I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible\r\nwork. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her\r\nsleep....",

    "_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible\r\nthing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;\r\nand by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,\r\noff on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we\r\nfollow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We\r\nhave our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only\r\nMorris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more\r\nGood-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.",
    "_Dr. Seward's Diary._",
    "_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing\r\naway from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a\r\ncluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly\r\nand there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own\r\nfeelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of\r\nwolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are\r\ndangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,\r\nand we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,\r\nor where, or what, or when, or how it may be....",
    "_Dr. Van Helsing's Memorandum._",
    "_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy\r\nat all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left\r\nMadam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.\r\nThe blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was\r\nuseful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty\r\nhinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that\r\nbeing entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served\r\nme here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I\r\nknew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if\r\nthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either\r\nthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.\r\nThen I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.\r\nThe dilemma had me between his horns.",
    "Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the\r\nVampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I\r\nresolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must\r\nsubmit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and\r\nfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the\r\nchoice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than\r\nthe grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.",
    "I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are\r\ninhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her\r\nVampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as\r\nthough I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when\r\nsuch things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,\r\nfound at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,\r\nand delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the\r\nwanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset\r\ncome, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair\r\nwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a\r\nkiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire\r\nfold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...",
    "There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence\r\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and\r\nheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such\r\nas the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,\r\nwith all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a\r\nyearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my\r\nvery soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the\r\nstrange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it\r\nwas that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields\r\nto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a\r\nlong, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound\r\nof a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.",
    "Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching\r\naway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not\r\npause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should\r\nbegin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in\r\na high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister\r\nwhich, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of\r\nthe mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so\r\nexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls\r\nsome of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl\r\nwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam\r\nMina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought\r\nfurther upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had\r\nsearched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as\r\nthere had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the\r\nnight, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.\r\nThere was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and\r\nnobly proportioned. On it was but one word",
    "DRACULA.",
    "This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more\r\nwere due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.\r\nBefore I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my\r\nawful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished\r\nhim from it, Un-Dead, for ever.",
    "Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it\r\nhad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had\r\nbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet\r\nMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived\r\nthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the\r\nyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....",
    "Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by\r\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of\r\nfear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though\r\ntill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen\r\nthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just\r\nere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been\r\nwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have\r\nendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of\r\nwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and\r\nleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them\r\nnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death\r\nfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife\r\nsevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and\r\ncrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come\r\ncenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud \"I\r\nam here!\"",
    "Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can\r\nthe Count enter there Un-Dead.",
    "When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her\r\nsleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.",
    "\"Come!\" she said, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my\r\nhusband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She was looking thin and\r\npale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was\r\nglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the\r\nfresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.",
    "And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet\r\nour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are\r\ncoming to meet us.",
    "_Mina Harker's Journal._",
    "_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\r\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did\r\nnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take\r\nheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being\r\nleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our\r\nprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we\r\ncould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of\r\nhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy\r\nwalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the\r\nclear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under\r\nthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\r\nCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,\r\nperched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\r\nseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\r\non any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We\r\ncould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the\r\nsound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\r\nfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about\r\nthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\r\nexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we\r\ncould trace it through the drifted snow.",
    "In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\r\nhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\r\nwith an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\r\nhand and drew me in: \"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter; and\r\nif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\" He brought in our\r\nfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\r\nforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\r\nrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\r\nnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\r\nreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\r\nof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--",
    "\"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!\" I sprang up and stood beside him on the\r\nrock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\r\nmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\r\nto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\r\nsnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\r\nwere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\r\nwhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\r\nkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\r\noff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\r\ngroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\r\nlong leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail\r\nwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\r\nsnow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were\r\npeasants or gypsies of some kind.",
    "On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\r\nfelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\r\nwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\r\nthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\r\npursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\r\nhowever, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\r\nthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\r\nnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--",
    "\"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!\" He took the glasses from\r\nme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\r\n\"See,\" he said, \"they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\r\ngalloping as hard as they can.\" He paused and went on in a hollow\r\nvoice:--",
    "\"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be\r\ndone!\" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\r\nlandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\r\nglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--",
    "\"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\r\nsouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\r\nblots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\r\nand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\r\nAt the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\r\nI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\r\nbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\r\nof course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\r\nthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\r\nand, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\r\nlaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\r\nopening of our shelter. \"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the\r\ntime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolver\r\nready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\r\nlouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\r\nIt was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\r\nand beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\r\ntowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\r\nsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\r\nnumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.",
    "Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\r\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\r\ncircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;\r\nbut at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\r\nclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\r\nlate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\r\nwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\r\nsun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\r\nthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\r\nbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\r\nand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\r\nhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\r\nthe snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\r\nparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\r\nnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\r\nseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\r\nand lower on the mountain tops.",
    "Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\r\nour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\r\nthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\r\npresence.",
    "All at once two voices shouted out to: \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan's,\r\nraised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute\r\ntone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\r\nthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\r\nspoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\r\nand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\r\nother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\r\nhorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\r\ncompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\r\nforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\r\nunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\r\nHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\r\nSeeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\r\nup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\r\ngypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\r\nhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.",
    "The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\r\nfront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\r\ntops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\r\nFor answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\r\nand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\r\nJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\r\nupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\r\nsurging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\r\nparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\r\nformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\r\nshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\r\norder.",
    "In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\r\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\r\nevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\r\nshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\r\nlevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\r\nthe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\r\nattention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\r\npurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\r\ncowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\r\ncart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\r\nbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\r\nMorris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\r\nSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\r\nwith the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\r\nseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\r\nthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\r\nI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\r\nbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\r\nwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\r\nspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\r\nas Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\r\nattempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\r\nthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\r\nlid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\r\nthe top of the box was thrown back.",
    "By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\r\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\r\nno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\r\nshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\r\nlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\r\nthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\r\nimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\r\nknew too well.",
    "As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\r\nturned to triumph.",
    "But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.\r\nI shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\r\nmoment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.",
    "It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\r\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from\r\nour sight.",
    "I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\r\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\r\ncould have imagined might have rested there.",
    "The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\r\nof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\r\nsetting sun.",
    "The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\r\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\r\nif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\r\nleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\r\nwhich had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\r\nus alone.",
    "Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\r\nhand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\r\nflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\r\ntwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\r\nhead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\r\nin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\r\nmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--",
    "\"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\" he cried\r\nsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \"It was\r\nworth for this to die! Look! look!\"",
    "The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\r\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\r\nthe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all\r\nas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\r\nspoke:--",
    "\"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not\r\nmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!\"",
    "And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\r\ngallant gentleman.",
    "NOTE",
    "Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of\r\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It\r\nis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same\r\nday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the\r\nsecret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into\r\nhim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but\r\nwe call him Quincey.",
    "In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\r\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\r\nterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things\r\nwhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were\r\nliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The\r\ncastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.",
    "When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all\r\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily\r\nmarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since\r\nour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the\r\nmass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one\r\nauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later\r\nnote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.\r\nWe could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as\r\nproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with\r\nour boy on his knee:--",
    "\"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day\r\nknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her\r\nsweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so\r\nloved her, that they did dare much for her sake.\"",
